            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I am ſorie that my skill is no better, to helpe you forwarde in that ſo excellent a woorke: but foraſmuch as God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth vs according to that meaſure we haue receiued, I hope you of your Honorable curteſie, will likewiſe take it well, that I ſhewe this remembrance of you in preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch a preſent as he hath beſtowed vpon me. And this I will ſaye: though in reſpect of my labour it bee
<pb facs="tcp:7669:3"/> homely, yet in reſpect of the matter it is moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: a work of one of the rareſt inſtruments who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vp, in theſe laſt tymes to giue light amidſt our great ignorance, &amp; to draw many to that bleſſed knowledge, which I beſeech God we may both thankfully accept of: &amp; alſo diligently co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forme ourſelues with all obedience, to liue according to it: that the Lord do not either take this bleſsing from vs, or els bring vpon vs ſeuere iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for abuſing ſo excellent a treaſure. I know ſome vntha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kful wretches, puffed vp with pride &amp; a vaine opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of them ſelues, wil hardly endure that I ſhould ſpeak thus either of the woork, or of this ſingular inſtrument of God. For the nature of mens corruption is ſuch, and ſpecially of ſuch as ſeke to be magnified one of another, that they tread vnder their feete Gods glorie: and being behinde others in giftes, they powte and ſwell againſt them whoſe ſhoe latchets they are not worthy to looſe: Beſides that they are ſo corrupt, either being open Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes, counterfeite profeſſours or manifeſt heretiques, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> abide no ſinceritie. Of the firſt ſort I wil not ſay much, becauſe nowe I minde not at large to diſpute with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as being the open &amp; hopeles enimies of God (I meane the obſtinate ones) who ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſeruants, but againſt his holy word. For what ſhould a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſay to ſuch, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nothing can pleaſe, but that they haue receiued either fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own brains, or els fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſottiſh doctors, who are deſtitute of al truth &amp; god lines? what they tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be it neuer ſo ſillie, nay ſo falſe, they wil receiue with al griedines: No Legende ſo lying, no opinion ſo groſſe, no motiue ſo light no life ſo vilai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, as they wil not accept of, maintain &amp; defend, both with tooth &amp; nayle, if it come fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their own polſhorne generation. But a lack it ſhould be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, if they would be content to haue all things tried by that vndeceiuable touchſtone that god hath appointed: If the euerlaſting word of god which of right (proceding fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god) ought to haue his prehemi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of perfection to
<pb facs="tcp:7669:3"/> iudge al) did beare the bel, as alſo god hath appointed it ſhuld do, this matter would be ſoone at an end. For what ſoeuer building ſhould be found, either in the one or the other, that had not his fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation therin, it ſhould quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vaniſh, &amp; euery mans work ſhould appeare. But if men wil come with preiudicate minds, to be admirers of mens Perſons, &amp; wil only look to a perſonal &amp; local ſuccesſion and bee caried away with the emptie &amp; bare titles of their names and profesſions, without examination of that they bring, men ſhall eaſily offende both in the one and in the other. Let all men therefore be examined, let the word of God diſcuſſe according to her prerogatiue: when God ſpeaketh let all men hold their peace, and if he teach, let all fleſh be confounded. In matters of faith and religion, let that word onely be heard which is the true iuſtructer, hauing bin ſet down by men as writers, yet by the holy ghoſt the true inditer, who came not to ſuggeſt a peece, &amp; ſo to leaue an imperfect work, but to lead vs into al truth, &amp; to teach vs whatſoeuer was nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſary for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; not leauing things doutfully to be receaued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hand to ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d by way of traditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but plainly written to remain to all the ſonnes of God as gods ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient &amp; perpetual Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Fy vpon theſe blaſphemous mouthes that wil accuſe God of infidelitie, of crueltie of lack of care to his Church in prouiding for his: that like high traytors dare clippe &amp; adulterate his coine, wring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcepter of his kingdom out of his hand, &amp; boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his gouernment to ſome one people, citie &amp; coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, as did the <hi>Donatiſts:</hi> chalenging to them ſelues with the olde <hi>Chatariſts,</hi> and new <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and ſuch as are of the <hi>Family of loue,</hi> that they cannot erre, when the moſte of their Popes (and ſpecially ſuch as followed him that proudly to ſhewe him ſelfe Antichriſt, chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the name of vniuerſall Biſhop) were Sorcerers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers, Whoremongers and inceſtuous lyuers, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, Murtherers, Sodomiters, couetous Harlots, and cruel blapſhemers in all their doings. I ſtand not to cite
<pb facs="tcp:7669:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> the places out of their owne ſtories, they are manifeſt, and all the worlde may knowe them. And as for their Councelles they were nothing but wranglinges and repeales one of anothers Lawes and Canons: their cuſtomes drawne from mennes errors, and therefore (as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth) beeing without trueth, though they were neuer ſo olde, are but olde errors. And yet wee leaue the fountaine, and goe too the ſtinking puddles that they haue digged vnto them ſelues: we muſt leaue the light of God, and goe to the darkeneſſe of men: the inſtruction of the holy Ghoſte, &amp; reſt vpon theſe Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that knowe not what they ſay, nor whereof they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, The word of God muſt be drawen in and out by them as they thinke good, and therefore they ſpeake moſte deſpightfully of it. They call it a deade letter, a noſe of Waxe, a Shipmans hoſe, a Schoole miſtreſſe of error, darke, harde, inſufficient of it ſelfe, and I cannot tell what. And yet as I ſaide, if any thinge come from their Dunces, they receiue it and neuer diſtruſt it. The name of a Catholique is inough to authoriſe vnto them any thing be it neuer ſo falſe, abſurde, peeuiſh and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the knowen and expreſſe trueth of God. They cry the Church, the Church, no otherwiſe then craftie ſtrumpets that wil moſte ſcolde for their honeſtie, when they neuer came where it grewe. And then they brable with vs about the tranſlation, O it is corrupted, it is not according to the Hebrew text, &amp; to diſcredit that which maketh moſt againſt them: beſides that, they forbidde the people the reading of it, they beare the worlde in hande, that they haue obſerued ſo manye and ſo manye faultes, when all men of learning and iudgement knowe that the time wherin their errors were moſt palpable &amp; rife, all kind of good learning was worne out, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of tongues decreaſed, they whom they moſt ſpited were the lighters of their Candles before all the world. For to themſelues Hebrewe letters though (as they ſay)
<pb facs="tcp:7669:4"/> they were as bigge as Okes, yet they were Pitchforkes and ſtaples: and as for Greeke, they were ſo farre from vnderſtanding of it, that not one amongeſt a thouſande coulde reade it. I ſpeake not of the latter times, for now good learning beeing brought to light, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel many of them haue tinded their Candles at our lights, and many (thankes be to God) are conuerted, and more ſhould be, had not God in his iuſtice for their wicked Rebellion made the meanes fruitleſſe, reſeruing them to a farther iudgement.</p>
            <p>But let vs ſee, where they euer amended any thing they blamed. Their common tranſlation hath bin amended by vs, to which yet ſo obſtinate they are, that all vppon payne of the blacke curſe in their conſpiracie of <hi>Trent,</hi> muſt be bound onely to holde them ſelues: when as in many places for their liues, they are not able to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtruction or ſenſe of it. But the obſcurer it was, the better liked of them, and the more to their profite: and therfore they kept it vnder &amp; forbad the reading of it, leſt the light thereof ſhould diſcouer their faultes and filthy corruptions. And this is the principall cauſe that <hi>Caluine</hi> and ſuch notable men are ſo yll liked, and with ſuch violence condempned amongſt them. But what ſhould good men looke for other of theſe blinde <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites,</hi> but ſuch condemnation? The other ſort are thoſe, that hauing once taſted of the ſweete doctrine of the Goſpel, are yet through an indiſciplinate kinde of life, beeing alſo deuoyde of true humilitie, caryed away from the ſinceritie of the trueth, ſome ſlugging ſtill in darke ignoraunce, and foding them ſelues in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, beleeuing nothing but that which they can compaſſe, &amp; receiuing nothing but that which ſtandeth to the lyking of their humors &amp; graueled conſciences, following like Swine their owne beaſtly and carnall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites. Theſe men would be awakened. And when the Lord ſhal open their eyes, they ſhal ſee that the profesſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:5"/> of the goſpel of God, conſiſteth not in a bare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesſion, they ſhall finde that the councell of God in parte reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it ſelfe, by our vocation: which alſo is from him, &amp; then they ſhall knowe them ſelues to be effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when they finde ſanctification as a continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion in them: which is approued and knowen by mortifying the olde Adam in vs, and by quickening the inwarde man, in that dayly reparation that maketh vs as deere Children too reſemble our heauenly father. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede we ſhall come ſhorte in the perfection therof, but he that is perfect ſhall ſupply our wantes, bothe ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening vs to will and performe what ſoeuer is good, &amp; alſo perfecting in himſelfe that which is imperfect in vs. Theſe men would be warned not to abuſe the Goſpel of grace, and the glad tydings of their euerlaſting ſaluation too their owne perdition: who whilſt they ſpeake of Chriſt ſhould indeuour to knowe him as he is: that his bare name deceaue them not, too lull them a ſleepe in ſinne, and whilſt they ſeeke to comforte the oppreſſed, ſhould likewiſe take heede that they ſtrengthen not the wicked, to continue in their curſed ſecuritie and fleſhly libertie. It is very true that in Chriſt we haue all things, but Chriſt withall his riches onely belongs to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to them hee is applyed with all his benefites, through a true and liuely faith: and he hath ſundrye of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, to which, his muſt ſubmit themſelues. They muſte acknowledge his kingdome to be ruled by his word, and they muſt be ſubiect to his lawe, who hath thorowly and continually prouided for their gouernment. They muſt reſt in that which he teacheth, becauſe he is their onely Prophet, their onely Prieſte, in whoſe onely ſacrifice the father is pacifyed and well pleaſed. And Chriſte is the marke to whome the lawe leadeth, the end and perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, that they in him ſhould walke in obedience. The laſt ſorte which are as ill as the worſt, I meane either open or elſe cloſe and craftie Heretiques, they can as ill
<pb facs="tcp:7669:5"/> brooke the ſincere worde of God as any of the others, bleating alſo againſte his gouernment and diſcipline, becauſe it reſtrayneth, correcteth and bridleth their he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticall opinions and manners. They alledge ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much ſeueritie, continually abuſing his mercie, and like fantaſticall wretches, becauſe they would be left to them ſelues to ſpew out their hereſyes, they continually barke againſt this wholeſome correction and holy obedience. Theſe fellowes pick many quarrels, making it ſubiect to the inconſtant willes of Popes and ignorant Princes, as though it were a Shipmans hoſe, to be altred and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at their pleaſure. But alack they doe but catch the winde in a net: For it muſt needes be that Chriſtes ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bruſe them, and it preuayle. And ſpecially they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide ſuch men as this good <hi>Caluine</hi> was, becauſe hee rubbed them on the gawle, and brake euen the ſkull (as I may ſay) of their hereticall corruptions. For ſome of them are <hi>Arians,</hi> other ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and <hi>Seruetians, Dauidians</hi> and <hi>Syluaniſts, Pelagians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Freewil men, Libertines</hi> and of the <hi>Familie of Loue,</hi> ioyning with them infinite hereſies, and ſecretly in this ſecuritie of the Church, diſperſe their poyſon, which I feare me, wil one day ſo breake foorth when we leaſt thinke of it, too the trouble of the whole Church of God, that it will bee a long time or euer it be purged and appeaſed. I would to God there were none in England, I woulde to God they had fewer fauourers, and wee more iudgement and zeale too defende the ſincere trueth of our God, then ſhould they not giue ſuch euident tokens of the venim that is within them, in defending <hi>Seruetus</hi> that Dogge that hath renewed all the olde hereſies of the <hi>Arrians,</hi> that ſomuch troubled the Church in time paſt: neither would they them ſelues in their own fantaſies with ſuch impudencie condemne the deere ſeruants of God, for procuring and calling vpon the magiſtrate for his lawful execution againſt Heretiques and empoyſoners of the
<pb facs="tcp:7669:6"/> Church. They would not make a maſh &amp; hotchpotch of the ciuill and eccleſiaſticall ſtate, and ſo iumble them togither. They would not deny the power of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſword, committed to his miniſters not in vaine, but to be vſed in cutting off the rotton members therof, for the preſeruation of the whole body. They would not bark ſo like Dogges againſt the euerlaſting predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and election of God, the moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable doctrine that can be, being the foundation of all the reſt, where it is wiſely taught according to the worde, and learned within that ſober co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe that it is preſcrybed: ioyning and iumping ſo neere with <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> the ſprituall illuminate, <hi>Pelagians,</hi> and other merite mongers, who howſoeuer they differ in ſome particular markes, yet are birdes of one and the ſame fether. This ſhall alwayes be found true that they followe the corrupteſt men of our age in all theſe matters. But whatſoeuer they ſay, Gods trueth is of ſufficient power to ouercome all their here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall blaſphemies. <hi>Moyſes</hi> rod ſhall deuour their Sorce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſerpentes. <hi>Dagon</hi> ſhall breake his neck where his trueth is receiued. And this ſunne aryſing ſhall ſcatter all their darkeneſſe. Theſe excellent inſtrumentes ſhall liue when they ſhalbe forgotten, vnleſſe it bee in immortall ſhame &amp; opprobry. Let vs not therfore be diſcouraged but holde faſt the trueth of our good God, &amp; with feare and reuerence, let vs ſeeke after thoſe things he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed vnto vs. There can be no daunger if we keepe our ſelues within the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mpaſſe of the holy Scriptures. For this doctrine of Gods eternall election and Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is moſte comfortable. O, but ſay they with the olde Heretiques, if I be elected and predeſtinated, what neede I too auoyde euill woorkes, they ſhall neither fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor hinder mee: God is ſure and what neede I tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and vexe my ſelfe to doe well &amp; to leade a ſtraight and a godly life, wee like not theſe pepered conſciences! Such heretiques there were long agoe that ſo wrote and
<pb facs="tcp:7669:6"/> taught that occaſioned Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> too write that excellent worke of the Predeſtination of Gods Saintes, confuting ſuch caytifes as theſe. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore annſweareth them, that this doctrine is a moſte comfortable doctrine, neceſſary to be knowen, too bee publiſhed and preached to the people in his due time and place. For it is that ſame euerlaſting and vnchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able decree of GOD, whereby hee hath vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly determined in the time that hee him ſelfe beſt knoweth, to cal his elect to the knowledge of his trueth, that his mercie and glory might bee declared in them. And this hath the Scripture confirmed <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>verſe.</hi> 30. Whome he hath predeſtinate thoſe hee hath called, and whom he hath called thoſe he hath iuſtified. And againe in the firſt Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> wee are elected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the foundations of the worlde, and in the 9. to the <hi>Romains</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> (of whome theſe Sermons eſpecially intreate) he ſaith that one was elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and the other reiected before they had doone either good or euil. The fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation heereof, is only the purpoſe of his wil: not forſeeing (as the Papiſts ſay) any worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes or vnworthines of man: but for iuſt cauſes known to himſelf, &amp; in himſelf not in vs in which without further inquirie we ought to reſt, acknowledging him to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, wiſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; moſt righteous, who is &amp; ſhalbe bleſſed and iuſtified for euer. Now for them that are either reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or elected, we wade no farther to iudge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then may appeare by the effectes, neither doe we iudge abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely of them, but with condition vnleſſe vppon thoſe peculiar loſte ones of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God himſelf in his word hath pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced. Read <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. &amp; 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Now if any Potſhard wil reaſon with the potter, which not reſting in his will, would wade further to know the ſecrete cauſes of this, we ſay vnto him with the Apoſtle: O wretched man who art thou that diſputeſt with God. Shal the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus?
<pb facs="tcp:7669:7"/> For further ſatiſfaction in this queſtion, I referre al Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to the Bookes that are written heereof, &amp; namely to theſe excellent Sermons: M. <hi>Knox</hi> hath learnedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared the obiections of the aduerſaries in a Booke printed at <hi>Geneua.</hi> Wee haue alſo home writers, that haue delt fully and plainly therein, as <hi>Veron</hi> of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and M. <hi>Crowley</hi> in his booke againſte <hi>Cerberus,</hi> rightly ſo called for his barking blaſphemyes, againſte this moſt comfortable and excellent doctrine: others that are learned may further ſatiſfie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, with thoſe learned anſweres of M. <hi>Beza</hi> againſt that impure Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtata <hi>Caſtalio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And nowe to returne to your Honours, I moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeech you to acccept my poore labours, which I offer vnder your Honours names to the whole Church of God. And I beſeech your honours, as God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led you to the knowledge of his glorious Goſpel, which is a token of your election, ſo goe forwarde more and more in the grouth therof: that the Goſpel being true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in your hearts, it may bring forth ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the true ſeale of your adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that you may feele his goodnes in the aſſurance of that euerlaſting and bleſſed inheritance. God hath called you to high honor, not ſo much by your places &amp; calling amongſt men (which yet is ſomwhat, becauſe it is a great benefite of God) but in that he hath made you his adopted children, it is that you ſhould ſhewe obedience, in that hee hath made you heyres with his ſonne, and Citizens with his Saintes, it is that you ſhould looke vp to Heauen and haue your ioy there deſpyſing this worlde, and liuing to righteouſnes and true holyneſſe. And this will the Lorde in mercie beſtowe vpon you, thereby ſealing your election, if you ſeperate your ſelues from the corruption of the world: I ſay not that you ſhould go out of the worlde, but that you ſhould departe from euill, and be followers of God as deare children, walking in loue, euen as he hath loued
<pb facs="tcp:7669:7"/> you. Beware of theſe twoo Cankers that corrupte the whole worlde, and is moſte likely to aſſayle No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, I meane Pride and Couetouſneſſe, Let them not once bee named amongeſt you as becommeth Saintes. A day wyll come, when the Lorde will fulfill your hope in better thinges then all this worlde can geue you. Stand faſt in his trueth in theſe ſlipperie daies, and aboue all thinges let his glory, and the aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his woorde, bee deare and precious vnto you. In Gods matters, let his will bee the rule thereof, and not your owne wiſedome and affections. Examine your ſelues often by it, and neglect not holy exerciſes. Let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Gallantes of this worlde, followe theyr fooliſh and fadyng pleaſures, delight you in his lawe, and be good examples to others. Care not for the contempt of the worlde, but holde faſt a good conſcience that you may be approued before GOD. The Lorde Ieſus bleſſe you both, that as he hath knit you togeather, ſo you may drawe on forwardes in one yoke to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes his kingdome, that that may bee your aime and mark in all your deedes, woordes, and thoughtes.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E haue heere to conſider the differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes putteth betwixte the Children of Abraham. We haue ſeene already that the whole ſtocke which hee had by Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turah, dwelled in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie farre off. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Iſmael he is ſeperated farre inough from the land of Caanan notwithſtanding he be yet as one reiected. For it was neceſſary that the inheritance which was ordained to Iſaack, ſhould remaine to him. Now in the firſt place it is ſaide, that Iſmael had twelue ſonnes, the which in ſuch ſorte multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, that of them came twelue Peoples. In this we ſee that God not without cauſe ſaid to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant Abraham,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.20.22.</note> that for his ſake Iſmael alſo ſhould haue a certaine bleſſing: but that it ſhould be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitorie and fleeting, and the principall ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to Iacob. But whatſoeuer it bee: yet ſo it is, that God did ſhewe himſelfe faithfull and true in his promiſe, the which belongeth to this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
<pb facs="tcp:7669:9"/> life. If God would that his trueth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie ſhould be knovven in theſe thinges of the vvorld, vvhich ſlip avvay, and haue nothing elſe but a figure which vaniſheth, as S. Paul ſaith: what ſhall it bee, when the promiſes are of farre greater importance, as when he calleth vs to the inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? Think we the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be fruſtrate of that, ſtaying our ſelues vpon him? See then how we muſt make our profite of this place. If God wil bee knowen firme and faithful in his word towards thoſe which are as ſtraungers, and which he hath ſhut out &amp; reiected fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his church: what will he then doe towardes vs which are his children, whome he hath adopted, &amp; to whome it hath pleaſed him to ſhew himſelf nie? For if God in ſmall things, as in the ſtock, &amp; in al other things of like ſort, wil haue his trueth knowen? what ſhal it be, when in the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, he ſetteth out vnto vs the inheritaunce of heauen, &amp; declareth vnto vs that he wil be merciful vnto vs, &amp; that he wil pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our faults, that we may be reconciled to him, &amp; that by this meanes we may be the brethren and companions of Angels, vnder one head, to wit, our Lord Ieſus Chriſt? Can God there faile in his promiſes? Shall they be void and without effecte and execution? It is impoſſible. This then is that wee haue to holde in this firſte place. And further vve haue next to note, that God will manifeſt him ſelfe not onely to vs in theſe his benefites, which are moſte great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, but alſo in thoſe that concerne this life: and that there is nothing ſo ſmall, in which he wil
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:7669:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> not haue ſome markes of his fatherly goodneſſe imprinted. And for aſmuch as he hath ſaid that he will haue care to feede vs, let vs waite vppon him, for all that which belongeth to the maintenaunce of this life, and let vs not think that it derogateth any whit from his maieſtie, in that he will haue vs to call vpon him for drinke and for foode to feede vpon. For he will that in all and through all wee ſhold haue our recourſe to him: let vs not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dout but that God (albeit our bodies be earth &amp; aſhes, rottennes &amp; wormes meat, &amp; as the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon ſpeech is, but carrions, which are nothing woorth) wil yet notwithſtanding prouide for all our corporall neceſſities. This is that we haue to adde as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point. But now we muſt heere ſee the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, which Moyſes maketh betwixt Iſmael and Iſaack. Beholde Iſmael which is cut off, &amp; is no more reputed among the children of God, and yet notwithſtanding we ſee that he proſpereth, &amp; that he hath a great train. For of twelue ſonnes which hee hath begotten, beholde twelue peoples that came from him. And withall of Iſaack, what? Iſaack maried at xl. yeres old: &amp; after that his wife was barren, &amp; that not for one yeere, nor for two, but eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for xx. yeres ſpace, he had no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. God had ſaid vnto him: <hi>I wil multiply thy ſeed, at the ſtarres of heauen, &amp; as the ſand of the ſea.</hi> This was pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to his father Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but this was of ſpeciall fauour toward him. But he might haue beene before this time increced, as he hoped, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he ſaw that his wife was barren, &amp; it ſeemed as though godminded to mock him, &amp; declare vnto him that
<pb facs="tcp:7669:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> thing which he hoped for, was nothing worth. When therefore he ſawe that his brother Iſmael, who had no roote in the church, who was a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger from all hope of ſaluation: vvhen he ſaw him (I ſay) to flouriſh in his ſeede, &amp; it ſeemed that God had poured forth all his graces vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: &amp; in the meane time, that he was left in his owne houſe all alone, and had none to ſucceede him: it is certaine that hee might be in great perplexitie, as if it had beene much better for him to haue beene like his brother Iſmael.</p>
               <p>This was to make him giue ouer al, &amp; after to be without hope, and to haue contemned God: he had falne euen to the vttermoſt extremitie, if he had not bene holde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in by a ſingular patience. Now then, wee haue heere to beholde as in a glaſſe, the condition of Gods Church, how it beginneth, &amp; how God vpholdeth it, and multiplyeth it, that is to ſay, after ſo ſtrange a faſhion, that it ſeemeth at al aſſaies, that that ſame apparance which God ſhall haue giuen vs, is nothing (as a man would ſay) but to deceiue vs. For (in ſtead that the children of this world haue a goodly ſhew, &amp; a man ſhall find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to encreaſe to the eye) the church ſhall bee hidden vnder the Earth: a man ſhall ſee the earth full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed of vnbeleeuers, of contemners of God and prophane people: and where ſhall a man finde the faithfull? They ſhall bee very thin ſowen and a man ſhall not be able to perceiue them, they ſhall be deſpiſed, men ſhall treade them almoſte vnder their feete, and men ſhall thinke that God hath no
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7669:10"/> care of his Church, and that further hee taketh pleaſure that the wicked, ſhould make their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphes, and ſhould haue their braue &amp; pompeous ſhewes.</p>
               <p>Now then this is ſhewed vnto vs in the perſons of Iſaack &amp; of Iſmael, to the end that the ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it trouble vs not beyond meaſure, and that we ſhould fight conſtantly againſt all doubtings which might ariſe in our imagination, as often as we do ſee a ſmal number of people which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, &amp; that we ſee almoſt an infinite number of thoſe which ſtubbernly ſet themſelues againſt him, and which knowe not what it meaneth too beare his yoke. Nowe this doctrine is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for vs at this day. For how doth God worke in our time? For when he ment to reare vp againe his Goſpell, at what end began he? What people called he? And yet now, if we caſt our eye vpon the whole world, wee ſhall finde in the firſt place, that in Aſia (which is the greateſt part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) all is diſordered and confuſed, and that there, ther is nothing but ſuperſtitions on the one ſide, and ſo vnruly barbarouſneſſe on the other, as pitie it is to beholde. Marke alſo the other parte of the world, to wit, Affrica, which is in the ſame order. And as concerning Europa (which men call Chriſtendom) let a man beholde that which is in Italie, in Fraunce, and other places, and a man ſhall finde that the Deuill beareth there the ſway, and that the vpholders of Antichriſt, who are deadly enemyes of the Church, what profeſſion
<pb facs="tcp:7669:11"/> ſoeuer they make, a man ſhall ſee them too hee as the Starres of Heauen, and as the ſande of the ſea: ſo as a man might ſay that there is nothing but for their vſe. And in deed they are very ſkilfull to make their vaunt thereof: for they make a buckler of this to contemne God, and alſo to harden them ſelues in their rebellion. They mock and deride vs for this, that vve are ſo fevve people, and that notvvithſtanding vvee vvill bee holden for the Church. But for our part vve are deſpiſed &amp; reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: and moreouer, wee are farre of from appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to this great people, which aduaunce them ſelues againſt vs: To bee ſhorte, a man would ſay, that wee are as three graines of Corne vnder a greate heape of Chaffe. And yet for all this it is ſo, that we haue this teſtimonie of God, that hee keepeth vs and auoweth vs to bee his houſholde ſeruants. For it is no Church, vnleſſe it be ioyned to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the head therof. When this faileth; all the reſt goeth to wrack and to ruine, as Saint Paule ſayth: <hi>Now wee are vnited to the ſonne of God, through the faith of his Gospel,</hi> which is the certaine and vndeceiuable bond. And howe ſhall we iudge that vve are the Church, ſeeing that we are nothing in compariſon of the vnfaithful, who are puffed vp by reaſon of their greatneſſe, and of all their other qualities, which they know wel inough how to ſet out with ful mouth? But let not vs be aſtoniſhed for al this, ſeeing that God hath giuen vs an allowaunce in the perſon of our father Iſaack, that the Church was as a forſaken
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7669:11"/> houſe, and that he had no ſtock, and that hee had not a great number of people, and yet for all that he ceaſed not to holde it as an hidden treaſure: let vs content our ſelues heerewith. And now for that which followeth, the perſon of Iſmael ought alſo to be wel marked: for hee came out from the houſe of Abraham, which at that time was the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Church in the whole worlde: he bare alſo cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as if he had bene an inheritour of the kingdome of God: yea he was the firſt borne, and had the ſwindge in the houſe, yea, in ſo much that he mocked his brother, as wee haue ſeene all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Now it is eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo likewiſe at this day concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Papiſts: for they are not ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers from the church, but they are as baſtard children. They will ſay alſo that they haue antiquitie on their ſide, and they we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t before vs: &amp; we ſe how they truſt in their ſucceſſion which they haue from the Apoſtles (as they ſay:) that at al times there haue been Biſhops &amp; prelates in their church, &amp; that herevpon a man might certainly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clud, that the title of the church belongeth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And yet for all this they are but baſtards as Iſmael was, foraſmuch as they were not begote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the goſpel as we haue heard, which is the ſeede of freedome: but haue corrupted them ſelues. Behold, how we may account the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. For albeit they be great peoples, &amp; that we in the meane time remaine as poore vntimely fruits, yet let vs know that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath giuen vs ſuche an example therof, that at this day we might not be aſhamed. This then to
<pb facs="tcp:7669:12"/> be ſhort, is that wee haue heere to remember. And heerevnto wee ought alſo to apply that which we read in the prophets. For it is not for once that this hapened, that the Church hath beene brought to a ſmall number, yea &amp; that it had nothing but hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deſolation in it: as in the time of the captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Babylon, what was it? For therevpon it is ſaid:<note place="margin">Eſay. 45.1.</note> by Eſay. <hi>Reioyce O barren that diddeſt not beare: breake foorth into ioy and reioyce, thou that diddeſt not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell with Childe: For the deſolate hath moe Children then all the maryed wiues: Albeit thou haſt beene as a widowe, God ſhall multiply thee, and thou ſhalt be a people, as it were by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, and aboue the iudgement and opinion of men, and when thou ſhalt haue ſtretched out thy Pauilions heere and there, all ſhall be filled and repleniſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When therefore wee heare that this is ſpoken to the Church, let vs knowe that if God at this day to humble vs or to puniſh our offences, doe diminiſh the number of them that call vpon him: we muſt not therefore quaile, but rather followe alwayes our vocation without any aſtoniſhment at all. And further let vs note that we ſee (ſpecially in the ſtate of the church) that which is ſpoken off in the 113. Pſalme:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 113.9.</note> That God filleth the houſes of thoſe that were barren before, with goodly Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and a great offſpring. Let vs waite then till our Lord doth his worke, and then we ſhall haue occaſion to glorifie him, knowing that it is not in vaine that he hath ſaid: that Abrahams ſeed ſhalbe multiplied: but that this muſt come after ſuch a ſort as is incomprehenſible vnto vs, &amp; that the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings are ſmall, &amp; as it were nothing. When then
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:7669:12"/> we ſhall haue this patience, it is certaine that God will woorke in ſuch ſort, as we ſhall haue alwayes whereby to be confirmed in his promiſes, ſeeing that the effecte ſhall ſhewe it ſelfe, yea and more then we could haue thought or wiſhed for. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore this we haue to mark heere in this place. But there is an other difficultie: too wit, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Iſmael bee ſo aduaunced, that he ſeeth ſo many ſucceſſours as is woonderfull, (for he liued an hundred, thirtie and vii. yeeres, and had twelue ſonnes) &amp; might ſe a people alredy diſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of his ſtock. Although for a time he were ſo lifted vp, yet within a while after he was as one taken away: For Moyſes in deede rehearſeth thoſe children he had, but when he ſpeaketh thereof in the holy hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, they are reiected and haue no fellowſhip with that true ſtock of Abraham which was bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: euen ſo let vs note that it is nothing to haue like authoritie, and to haue a greate ſhowe, and goodly hue amonge men, &amp; to be in reputation, namely ſo as men wonder at vs, yet all this is worth nothing in compariſon of the durable ſtate of the Church.</p>
               <p>God ſetteth vp his houſe in ſuch ſorte, that it ſeemeth as a plaie of little Children: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the foundations are perpetuall. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he continueth his grace, in ſuch ſorte; that a man may very well ſee, that it is hee which is the founder of his Church, which buildeth, finiſheth, and vpholdeth it. This plainely appeareth: yet the vnbeleeuers haue their diſcourſes and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:13"/> in ſuch ſorte, that they are as the graſſe which groweth vpon the houſe toppes, like as it is ſaid in the 129. Pſalme: The corne ſhalbe troden vnder feete, and men caſt it into the earth, &amp; it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth there in a lowe place, and in the meane vvhile, behold the graſſe which ſhall growe very high vpon the houſe toppes: but in aſmuch as it is neerer to the Sunne it taketh no roote: ſo that it muſt needes wither, in ſuch ſorte that there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth no fruite of it, as the Prophet there ſheweth. Euen ſo then, when we ſee that the Lorde keepeth vs in this poore and lowe condition, and that not onely we are deſpiſed, but as it were vtterly reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of all: let vs knowe, that it ought to ſuffice vs, that wee haue a roote in our God, to liue by his grace for euer: that we are maintained by him, and that we are as a tree pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by the riuers ſide, which alwayes ſhall be moyſtened with vvater to drawe out nouriſhment there from. Let vs content our ſelues heerewith. And ſo this compariſon is not made without cauſe, when Moyſes expreſly ſaith that Iſmael begate twelue ſonnes, which were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered into twelue peoples, &amp; after that, hee ſtayes there, and ſo leaues them. Further he ſayth: <hi>Beholde the generations of Iſaack.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why? it is for that his wife was barren, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til that he was come to the age of Lx. yeres. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a wonderful thing, yea but vve ſhal find, that after God had ratified his promiſe, to wit, that hee ſhould be multiplyed in ſuch ſorte, as hee had ſhewed vnto him, that he had not ſpoken in vaine. For what was it to ſee ſuch a multitude of people
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:7669:13"/> in Egypt, as if graſſe had growen in the mideſt of an hot burning Ouen? For this was as a fornace, (as the ſcripture ſpeaketh) which was the tyranny &amp; bondage of Egypt. Behold the people as chaffe, and ſee the fire which is kindled in euery place all about, and yet for all this the people is not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, like as is ſhewed in the figure of the Buſhe,<note place="margin">Exod. 3.2.3.4. Acts. <hi>7.30.</hi>
                  </note> which was as it were burning on a light fire, and yet the buſh remained whole and was not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. We ſee likewiſe how the people multiplied, beeing vnder ſuch oppreſſion and anguiſh, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was not only queſtion of an hundred thouſand, or of three or foure hundred thouſande, but beholde ſix hundred thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iſſuing out vnder ſuch a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie. And how was this poſſible? Beholde a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to rauiſh vs in aſtoniſhment. Now then let vs know, that as God after this maner tryed the faith and patience of Iſaack, ſo in the ende he founde a meane to accompliſh his promiſe, yea beyond the reach of man. For this came to paſſe after a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge faſhion, &amp; which a man would not haue thought. Let vs alſo at this day apply this to our ſelues, and let vs practize that which is ſpoken in the 37. Pſal. If we ſee the wicked &amp; the contemners of God to be aduanced as the Cedars of Libanon, let vs wait: for there needs no more, but euen to turn our eyes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.10.</note> and loe, they are razed &amp; cut off, and one ſhall not ſee ſo much as the place where they were. And why ſo? Becauſe they were not planted in God. Wee heare that which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaith, Matth. 15.<note place="margin">Matt. 15.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Euery plant which my heauenly father hath not planted ſhall be rooted vp.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>So let vs not enuie the Children of this world, vvhen wee ſhall ſee them in high eſtate, when wee ſhall ſee them aduaunced to nobilitie and to dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and in all other things: let vs waite patiently and learne our condition peaceablie: and if the world doe mock vs, make no accounte of vs, and diſdaine vs, let it ſuffice vs notwithſtanding to bee eſteemed before God and his Angels. And in the meane time let vs waite, till God accompliſh that he hath ſpoken in another place, <hi>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like a Palme tree,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal. 29.</hi>12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſhall growe like a Cedar in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon:</hi> yea, after another faſhion: for he ſaith, he ſhalbe multiplyed in the courts of the houſe of the Lord. When it is ſaid, that they ſhall be planted in the houſe of God, that is to ſay, they ſhalbe ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed of him: For, beholde alſo wherein our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall felicitie conſiſteth, ſo as from age to age, we may alwayes ſtande faſt, as it is ſaide in the 112. Pſal. That inaſmuch as God abideth for euer one, &amp; changeth not as doth the world which waxeth olde and groweth in corruption: but that God is alwayes like himſelf: The Prophet therupon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, that the faithfull ſhall haue their abiding: and that albeit at the firſt bluſhe a man ſee not that the grace of God is ſhewed vpon them, yet in the end, it ſhall be knowen.</p>
               <p>This therfore hetherto is that we haue to learne of this place, and of this difference which Moyſes putteth heere betwene the ſtock of Iſmael, &amp; that of Iſaack. Beholde theſe beginnings of the church which are as a thing of nothing, but the finiſhing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:7669:14"/> thereof is wonderful. Now the beginnings of the children of this world are mightie and noble, and ſuch as aſtoniſh all men: but all comes to nothing. And why ſo? Becauſe they haue no continuing in the promiſe of God. This is the fountaine of life: and beholde how wee may continue to the ende: this alſo is the meane to make vs to be aduaunced aboue the world. For when the queſtion is, of our reioycing in God, and of contenting our ſelues with his fatherly goodnes, that hee hath ſhewed vnto vs, Let vs not be as fooles to buſie our ſelues about that which we now ſee with the eye: For theſe preſent thinges of the worlde paſſe awaye and vaniſh: but let vs beholde that which is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as the true nature of Faith is,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith. Now Moyſes addeth,
<q>That Iſmael dwelt ouer againſt his brethern, or in their preſence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that one hath tranſlated this <hi>to dwell,</hi> and the woorde importeth <hi>to fall:</hi> but it ſignifieth to reſte, to dwell, and to haue a houſe. This then is the true and natural meaning, that Iſmael vvas not farre off (as already vve haue ſeene) from the children of Keturah, but that hee remayned a neere neighbour of the lande of Canaan, vvhich vvas promiſed to Iſaack: notvvithſtanding this is true alſo, that he poſſeſſed not that land there, for it vvas meete that he ſhould be barred from thence. And vvho is it that had driuen him thence? For after the death of Abraham, it is certain, that he might haue taried there if he vvold. Iſaack had
<pb facs="tcp:7669:15"/> nothing but the Sepulchre vvhich his father had gotten: he vvas not lead thence to haue any greate and large poſſeſſions: hee had nothing, vnleſſe it were altogether borrowed and by the leaue of the inhabitantes.</p>
               <p>Iſmael therefore might well haue made his abode and neſte there, if hee had liſted. But hee went from thence: was this to obay GOD? No, For he was ful of pride &amp; rebellion. So he would rather haue blaſphemed God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had thought I am heere put apart, as though I were not of my fathers houſe. Therfore I muſt ſtay my ſelf in the countrie vvhere I was borne. But God doth leade him thither vvithout his knovvledge, wherefore he goeth thither, yea by a ſecret inſpiration. See hovv God vvorketh tovvards the vnbeleeuers: he turneth them, he vvindeth them from one ſide to an other.</p>
               <p>We do not ſee apparantly that it is ſo: but vve muſte by faith conſider therein a prouidence of GOD, and if vve vvere very attentiue therein, it is certaine that vvee ſhould haue proofe of that vvhich is heere written and that dayly. For hovv is it that vve are not deſtroied of theſe mad beaſts, vvhich compaſſe vs on euery ſide? We ſee vvhat their crueltie is, and hovve inſatiable they are in their couetouſneſſe: Whervpon then ſtayeth it, that vve are not all ſvvallovved vp: but that God turneth avvay their furie, and that hee knovveth how to direct them as ſeemeth good vnto him? he vvil make them ſometimes to puſh one another:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:7669:15" rendition="simple:additions"/> further he keepeth them there as Lyons that are enchained and holden vvithin Iron barres. See then hovve God alſo at this day driueth and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the vnbeleeuers, vvhere hee vvill vvithout vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence at leaſt, ſo as they perceiue it not, euen as he did that at time vvith Iſmael. For we haue already declared, that he deſired nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvve and aboliſh the promiſe of God, vvhich vvas made vnto Iſaack, &amp; yet for all that he goeth not about it. And why ſo? Becauſe it vvas not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, and becauſe God doth place him there in a dwelling out of the vvay, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Thou ſhalt dwell neere thy brethren:</hi> but hovvſoeuer it be, thou ſhalt not hinder, but that they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the region vvhich I haue aſſigned vnto them for an inheritaunce. But hee ſpeaketh ſpecially of Brethren, &amp; yet for al that he had none but Iſaack: this is to ſhevve that God had no regarde to one or to tvvo, vvhen he ſo ſhut vp Iſmael: but as if the people had already inhabited the land of Canaan: the people I ſay, vvhich vvas not yet borne, yea, vvhich vvas not borne a long time after.</p>
               <p>This is the ſumme of that vve haue further to note heere. Novv heerevpon vve may be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſtrengthened, as often as vve ſee the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and contemners of God (vvho are ſo deadly enemyes to vs) to caſt out their froth, in that vve knovve that our Lorde can ſtay and holde them in vvell enough, and that hee vvill turne them ſome other vvay, and vvhen it ſhall ſeeme that they are to caſt and baniſh vs out of the worlde
<pb facs="tcp:7669:16"/> that our Lord will holde them as Captiues, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they knovve not hovv. To be ſhorte, this that is heere ſet out of Iſmael, vve ſhall haue tryall off, ſo that vve be patient, &amp; call vpon God, and nothing dout, but that he hath meanes of his ovvne in him ſelfe to ſaue vs, the vvhich vve at the firſt perceiue not. But novv let vs come to that vvhich Moyſes reciteth concerning Iſaack. It is true that thereof he had already ſpoken ſome thing, but it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that it be deducted more at large. He hath ſaid, <hi>That Iſaack was fortie yeeres olde, when he tooke Rebecca to wife,</hi> &amp; further that ſhe vvas barren. Novv it is like that Iſmael vvas maried ſooner. For vve haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeene that Hagar his mother had giuen him wife, without mention of his age, and a man may wel gather that he was then very younge. Iſaack commeth to the age of xl. yeeres and might al rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy be infeebled before he entred into mariage. See then how he was kept backe. Now let vs note that all this while paſſed not, but he often entered into reckoning, to inquire of this promiſe, which was made vnto him, that his ſeede ſhould be multiply-as the ſtarres of Heauen and the ſand of the ſea, and all this while he founde no wife, for he durſt not take one in the countrie. And it is like that God ſhewed him that he would keepe her barren euen til the end. But yet vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he vvas maried, it ſeemeth that then at the leaſt God vvould bleſſe him, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe and augment him in his ſtock. But his vvife is barren, yea by the ſpace of xx. yeeres. If any ſuch teptation ſhould come vnto any of vs, it is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:7669:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> certaine that the beſt of vs ſhoulde hardely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt it one day: wee lightly paſſe ouer that which is heere recited by Moyſes. And why ſo? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we be not exerciſed with many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>flicts, yea and becauſe we ſhunne them, and alſo by reaſon of infirmitie and rudeneſſe. Neuertheleſſe we ought to make our profite of ſuch examples, when wee come to any entry or tryall of our faith, wee are altogether vndoone. And why? Becauſe in time and place we are not ſo fenced as were neceſſary. Now it is ſaid here, that for the ſpace of xx. yeeres it ſeemed that Iſaack was accurſed of God, &amp; that he was in a maner a deade ſtock, and that hee had no hope of hauing any children during the ſpace of xx. yeeres. For heere is not queſtion of hauing children onely. As when men &amp; women do mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they will be glad to haue children: And this is alſo a token of Gods fauour, but heere was a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reaſon in Iſaack. For he wayted not onely for the people that ſhould deſcend of him, but he wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſaluation of the world. See then Ieſus Chriſt, which is after a ſort in his raines, as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for he vſeth the ſame maner of ſpeech there. Iſaack ſaw that he was barren, &amp; yet he had no other hope to be ſaued, he is as it were a curſed creature, &amp; as it were at the pittes brink, except he haue iſſue: &amp; all this while, that God which had made promiſe therof in the perſon of his father, ſeemeth to mock him &amp; leaueth him there, where he muſt needs languiſh: and that as often as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde his wife he might thus think with himſelf,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:17"/> Loe a glaſſe, wherein I ſee that God hath reiected vs, and that he maketh no account of vs, &amp; that hee hath turned his back towards vs, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is fruſtrate, that it hath no force or efficacie towards vs.</p>
               <p>See (I ſay) howe Iſaack had dayly to beare with ſuche aſſaultes: and wee ought well too waye all theſe thinges (as I haue already ſayde:) but foraſamuch as we doe not regard to what ende the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh vnto vs of Iſaack, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we knowe not howe to apply that to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which is here ſpoken of him: ſee why it ought to make vs loſe no courage at all: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is but one Blaſt of wind, by and by we are beaten downe. And why ſo? for we ought to haue thought thus on this ſort. Goe to, how is it that I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack hath ſo firme conſtancie, &amp; that for the ſpace of xx yeres? he quailed not, albeit, it ſeemed to him that GOD had mocked him: this was becauſe that he was patient, &amp; becauſe he knew, it behoued him not to ſet God the time wherin he had to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe: but that he muſt ſubmit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to him &amp; doe him this honor to know that his workes are incomprehenſible, and that hee knoweth the fitte times and ſeaſons, to performe that he hath pronounced: to bee ſhorte, that it is not our parte too ſet him a lawe: but that it is meete that we keepe ſcilence, and that wee mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure not, if thinges fall not out according to our appetite and deſire: but that wee muſte wayte till hee accompliſhe his owne woorkes,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:7669:17"/> yea, although wee ſee all thinges contrarye: Neuertheleſſe, it behooueth that our fayth preuayle agaynſt all the worlde, euen as Saynt Iohn ſayeth in his Canonicall Epiſtle. Nowe in as muche as all this is nothing, and it vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth from before our eyes: and when we reade this hyſtory, it is ſo coldely done, that wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue no fruite by it. See, alſo why GOD pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth vs for our ingratitude: becauſe wee are ſo delicate, that aſſoone as there commeth, not a ſtorme or ſome greate Whirlewinde, but a little puffe, beholde wee are foorthwith ſhaken, and in the ende doe fall away.</p>
               <p>So muche the rather then it behooueth that wee marke well that which is heere ſpoken: too witte, that Iſaack continued to truſte in GOD, although that by the ſpace of twentie yeeres, it ſeemed that he could haue no iſſue. Nowe that he perſeuered, it appeareth by that which Moyſes ſayth.</p>
               <q>For Iſaack prayed vnto the Lorde for his wife, and was hearde, ſo as his wife conceiued.</q>
               <p>When it is ſayd, that hee prayed to the Lorde, wee muſte not thinke that hee onely wayted til that time was accomplyſhed: but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his wife was barren, he had his recourſe to GOD, which was the onely remedy. What? ſeemeth it then that hee loſte his time, and that hee caſte his Prayers in the Ayre, and that they neuer came too Gods eares? For a man vvoulde ſay ſo. For if hee had beene hearde, would not
<pb facs="tcp:7669:18"/> God the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue declared by experience, that which hee had promiſed him? But he ſaw nothing of all that. Then when Iſaack had prayed one yeere, &amp; twaine: it is all one, as if hee had ſpoken to a Rock or to a wall: God making wiſe as though hee were deafe: that is to ſay, hee ſhewed not him ſelfe in any ſorte to haue a fauourable care to receiue Iſaacks requeſtes: and this continued. But when this commeth vnto the ende of tenne or twelue yeeres, what would a man ſay, but that it were better to giue ouer? For this is a marue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous harde and great temptation, that God ſhould doe nothing of that that hee had promiſed at the end of fifteene yeeres, But although hee had put off to doe it euen to the twentith yeere, yet neuertheleſſe Iſaack ceaſed not to pray, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes continued, and his prayer was a ſure ſeale of his Faith. For he prayed not after the maner of the vnbeleeuers, which euer waite to rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: but hee followed the rule that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs by Saint Paaule (although it was not yet written). And that was to ioyne thankeſgiuing with our prayers, referring our ſelues wholly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, &amp; quietly wayting for ſuch an iſſue from him as coulde not yet bee ſeene. Like as then when Iſaack continued ſtil ſo to caſt all his heaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe into the boſom of God, and all the care that oppreſſed him, and all the ſorrowes, griefes and anguiſhes, wherein hee was encloſed: when hee repoſed all this in the boſom of God, this was a ſure tryall of his faith.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:7669:18"/>
               <p>This then is that we haue to learne by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: to wit, that we think not that God hath bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d himſelf vnto vs to do al that he hath ſpoken at the firſt daſh: but after that hee hath once ſpoken, hee will not giue any ſigne to accompliſh his worke and we will think that all that hee had promiſed was nothing elſe (as men ſay,) but woordes and winde. It behoueth then that we be holden in, with ſuch patience: (as alſo the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vs heretoo,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.37.</note> in the tenth Chapter too the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brues) that from day to day, from yeere to yeere, and all our life long, and as if nothing were, that we holde our ſelues there in quiet and holde our peace before God, to the end weſkirmiſh not, nor make any broyle, nor pleade againſt him, nor ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon him, according as our fickle appetites wold moue vs. And heerevpon wee haue to put that in practiſe which the Apoſtle alleadgeth out of the Prophet Habacuc: That if hee forſlowe his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, we ſhould waite, and it ſhall not linger. Hee there ſetteth downe two things: hee ſaith in deede that the promiſe of God ſhall not be foreſlowed: that is to ſay, that it ſhall haue a certaine &amp; vndou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted execution, and in it, ſeaſon: But concerning vs and our ſenſe or feeling, he ſayeth, it ſhall linger: ſo that we haue neede patiently to wait. Beholde then howe our faith muſt be tried. For if we hope that God will ſhewe himſelfe faithfull towardes vs, and that we remaine firme and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that we be often againe and againe exerciſed in prayers and ſupplications: for faith muſt not be
<pb facs="tcp:7669:19"/> idle, to be ſhort, if we haue to liue here beneath, as poore miſerable wretches, &amp; that ſome muſt bee afflicted with diſeaſes, and others with pouertie, that euery one hath to endure many afflictions &amp; miſeries: that neuertheleſſe we goe forwarde, and that we know, when God promiſeth vs to be our father, it is not that he meaneth to ſhew it alwaies appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly to the eye. He wil giue vs in deed ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e taſt of his goodnes, aſmuch as ſhalbe neceſſarie, yea we ſhal haue therin to ſatiſfy our ſelues, ſo that our faith be alwaies ioyned therunto: in ſuch ſorte that we ſhall feele, that that which he hath pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced is not to deceiue vs.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11.</note> Open thy mouth &amp; I wil fil it. But howſoeuer it be, it behoueth that we waite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies by faith, for that which yet appereth not, &amp; which is as it were far from vs, and ſeemeth to bee impoſſible. Again, when we ſhalbe thus grounded and ſtayed vpon the truth of God, &amp; that we ſhall ſuffer our ſelues to be afflicted by many miſeryes, that yet, we haue that care and zeale to pray &amp; cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God both morning &amp; euening, &amp; haue our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe vnto him: for this is our only co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort. This therefore is not a thing lightly to be paſſed ouer, when Moyſes rehearſeth, that Iſaack prayed vnto god for the barennes of his wife, &amp; that God hard him. For on the one ſide we ſee the perſeueraunce which Iſaack had in ſtaying himſelf vpon God, &amp; making requeſt vnto him: on the other ſide we ſee that God was not deaf to his requeſts: but this was not, for that he ſhewed himſelfe at the firſt daſhe. For a man wold haue ſaid, that Iſaack was abuſed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7669:19"/> to run ſo vnto God morning and euening, &amp; that it had bene better that he had giuen ouer all: but at the end of xx. yeeres, God came ſuddainly, to the end he might ſhew that men are too haſty &amp; hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in their deſires: &amp; heere ſee, what is the cauſe that often times his name is blaſphemed, &amp; men will accuſe him for that he worketh not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our fantaſie: this (ſay I) proceedeth of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiencie. Now we haue alſo to note, that Iſaack knew that it was a great benefite of God, to giue him iſſue. For when God had pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced,<note place="margin">Gen. <hi>1.</hi>28.</note> 
                  <hi>Encreaſe and multiply,</hi> according as we haue ſeen, it is to ſhew that neither men nor beaſts could bring forth and increaſe, but by his power, that we ſhuld not think that it came by adue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture. If therfore Bulls, horſes, and Aſſes cannot ingender, vnles God ſhed out his bleſſing &amp; ſecret power, what ſhall be of men? For we are far more noble creatures, inaſmuch as god hath formed vs according to his owne image. So that when we ſee that both men and beaſts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by generation, we muſt therby call to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie that this is from the worde of God, which hath iſſued out of his mouth, <hi>Encreaſe and multiply,</hi> which yet euen at this day ſheweth it ſelfe, but we muſt go farther: to wit, that God keepeth this ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſing &amp; liberalitie to himſelfe, to the end to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it as he ſeeth good. For we ſe that al engender not alike: Some haue no Children, others one or twoo, and others againe haue them by dozens. So then when wee ſee ſuche an inequalitie, it behooueth is too acknowledge that it is a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
<pb facs="tcp:7669:20"/> benefite of God to haue children: as alſo it is expreſſely ſayde in the Pſalme, that the fruite of the wombe (for ſo the Scripture ſpeaketh) is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.3.</note> And ſo we muſt in this behalfe, haue recourſe vnto him. And therfore thoſe that deſire ſo greatly to haue children, they muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low alwaies the example of Iſaack. For they wil ſay in deede, ô I woulde haue Children: but of thinking vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, there is neither mention, nor newes. And foraſmuch as God is defrauded of his honor, loe, why he withdraweth his hand: or rather if he giue an ofspring, foraſmuche as they are a prophane people, hee will giue them chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren which ſhall ſcratch out their eyes. For their children are as young ſerpents, or thornes, for to pricke and pierce them euen to the hart. Behold therefore what is the cauſe that many haue no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring to ſucccede them: or if they haue, it is for their farther euil: foraſmuch as they haue not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to God, to obtaine all of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing. Let vs therfore mark wel, that that which is heere ſhewed as concerning our father Iſaack, is that he ſeeing his wife barren, prepared himſelf to God knowing very well, that it was of him that he ought to demaunde iſſue. And in deede, what will men alledge heere againſt this bleſſing? If we marke that which is written in Iob, that when a childe commeth into the worlde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iob.</hi> 14.</note> it is as a liuely image of the incomprehenſible power of God, which cannot be ſufficiently eſteemed. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is it that an infant is ingendered, and after it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:7669:20" rendition="simple:additions"/> is conceiued, howe commeth it in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the wombe of the mother? And further, howe is it, that hee commeth foorth? If a man marke all theſe things, who will be ſo brutiſh, to ſay that men engender them by their owne ſtrength and induſtrie? Let vs then holde faſt this leſſon: which is that they that are married and deſire offſpring, that they aſke it of God: &amp; that for two reaſons. The firſt, becauſe God hath reſerued this in his owne hand, as wee haue euen now alledged out of the Pſalme. The ſecond is, that it is not inough that their houſes be ful of children, vnleſſe that God alwayes gouerne them. For it were much better that they had no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring at all, then to haue a peruerſe ſeede, accurſed and ful of miſchiefe. So then let fathers learne (in this behalfe) to followe the example of Iſaack. But let vs alſo diligently note, that Iſaack prayed not for an ofſpring, only after the natural appetite of men: But he looked vp higher: that is to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that it behoued that of him ſhould proceede the ſaluation of the worlde in the perſon of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, the which ſhall bee deducted more at large heereafter.</p>
               <p>But now let vs fall downe before the holy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our faultes, and praying him that he will make vs too feele them more and more, and that it may be to humble vs, and to bring vs to true repentaunce: and that we may bee in ſuch ſorte touched with feare, that we may deſire nothing but to bee ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of all our earthly affections and luſtes to the
<pb facs="tcp:7669:21"/> ende wee may bee cloathed with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, vntill that hee ſhall haue drawen vs to a ful and perfect perfection. And that he wil not only doe this good vnto vs, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſawe yeſterday how God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the faith of Iſaack, before he gaue him any offspring, to wit, for the ſpace of xx. yeeres. Now to the end we ſhould knowe that he prayed not to God in vain, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God heard his requeſt, the which te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to this, that God might ſend the ſauiour of the world by meane of the ſeede that he had promiſed him. Now loe, whereein it was that Iſaack might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, and not after the common manner. For his wife had beene barren a long time, &amp; he ſaw that ſhe had conceiued, &amp; that God had declared that he had not forgotten his promiſe, &amp; after he knew that this was graunted him, foraſmuch as he had
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:7669:21"/> his recourſe to God. But ſe a newe temptation, and which is more hard and more greeuous to bee borne, then if his wife had remained barren. For ſhe conceiued two children, the which ſtrugled &amp; ſtroue togither in her belly. Now this was a very hydeous thing, and as it were againſt nature. And ſee wherefore alſo ſhe ſaide, that it had beene bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that ſhe had beene deade, &amp; this was not of any impatience that ſhe ſpake thus, as if ſhee had felte horrible torments &amp; ſorrowes that had conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned her vnto it: but ſhe looked vp higher. For ſhee bare in her wombe all the hope that might be had of the ſaluation of the world. Now in the meane time ſhe ſeeth ſuch a combate, that it ſeemeth that GOD ouerthroweth all, and that hee woulde ſhew therein a ſigne of his wrath. To be ſhort, the thing is deteſtable of it ſelfe, that there ſhould bee ſuch a ſtrife and battel in the wombe of a woman: &amp; this came not naturally, but God would now doe (as we haue ſeene) to Iſaack and to her, that all they that ſhould come of their ſeede after the fleſh, ſhould not therfore be reputed of the number of the faithful: but rather that there ſhould be mortal warre amongſt them. Now therfore whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſaw (in ſteade of hauing the ſaluation of the world in her womb) ſuch a ſigne of God his wrath, and as it were a diueliſh fight of deadly enemyes of the Church, ſhe could not knowe the whole: but ſhee perceiued, that if ſhe had conceiued to haue ſuch a combate, that this was, as if GOD had beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her, and come with a mayne armie, to ſay:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:22"/> Thou art vnto me as a deteſtable creature, and I haue caſt thee off and refuſed thee. In what caſe then is ſhe, when ſhe imagineth all theſe thinges? And ſo we ought not to thinke it ſtraunge, if in ſuch anguiſhe, ſhe woulde rather haue choſen too die, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee ſo monſtrous a thing, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the order of nature. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is ſaide, that in this ſo great heauines, ſhe left not off, to haue recourſe vnto God. And in very deede ſhee obtayned an anſwere to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort her: not but that there was alſo ſome griefe mingled therewith, but yet God did moderate this paſſion, that was ſo grieuous vnto her, and ſaid, that ſhe had two peoples in her wombe: as if he ſhoulde haue ſaide, that this was not onelie for the two childrens ſakes, which ſhee bare, but that this had a farther reſpect: that is to ſay, that they ſhould be deuided the one from the other. And howſoeuer both two were the ſonnes of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, and that it had beene ſaide vnto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, that in his ſeede all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed, yet it muſt needes be that from Iſaack ſuch muſt deſcend, as God ſhuld cut of from his Church, who ſhould be reiected, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſhould be the enemyes of the Church of God. Now it is very true that this might haue wounded both Iſaack and Rebecca with a deadly ſorow: but yet in the meane time they ſee that the goodneſſe of God was no whit quenched &amp; that God ſhewed himſelfe faithful in that he had once pronounced. For he had ſayd.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:7669:22"/>The elder ſhall ſerue the younger.</q>
               <p>Wherein Rebecca knew, that of her, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it ſhoulde be, ſhould come that bleſſed ſeede, which had bin promiſed. See in briefe the whole that is here rehearſed. But all would be darke, if it were not declared particularly. Let vs note here then, that they that are called into the Churche, doe not alwayes remaine there, as we haue ſeene a notable example in Iſmael: who was the eldeſt ſonne of Abraham, notwithſtanding he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from the familie, and it was ſaide, that hee ſhoulde not bee heire. And this was not of the riches of the worlde, nor of thoſe poſſeſſions, which Abraham had. For he was riche in cattel, in golde and ſiluer: but he had not one foote of lande. This heritage therfore, to what had it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect? Euen to the ſpirituall promiſe: that is too ſay, that God had choſen the ſeede of Abraham, which was as much to ſay, as this ſhalbe a people that ſhall be dedicated to my ſeruice: and thoſe that ſhall come of them, wil I receiue and accept for my children, to the ende I may gather them into euerlaſting life. Marke then howe Iſmael with his birthright is caſt from the hope of life: and it remaineth onely to Iſaack. And euen ſo is it herein, concerning Eſau and Iacob: For both theſe were deſcended of Abraham, yea they were twinnes, their mother bare them in one belly: yet that one is receiued, and the other reiected: one is choſen, and the other refuſed.</p>
               <p>So then we ſee that they, who for a time haue
<pb facs="tcp:7669:23"/> place in the church, &amp; beare the title of the faithful &amp; of the children of God, may wel be ſo accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted before men, but they are not writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the boke of life: God knoweth them not, nor auoucheth them for his. Hereby we are admoniſhed, not proudly to vaunt our ſelues, nor to be drunken with ſottiſh preſumption, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſhall ſhew vs this fauour, to bring vs into his church: but let vs walke in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, &amp; labor to make ſure our electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to haue the teſtimonie thereof in our heartes, by the holy Ghoſt, &amp; not to truſt only to the outwarde title &amp; apparaunce, which wee may pretende before the world: ſee what we haue heere too marke. And moreouer wee are taught a farre greater thinge: and that is in the firſt place: that albeit God had eſtabliſhed his couenaunt with Abraham, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he would declare that this was not all, to haue made offer of his grace: but that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houed that hee chuſe according to his libertie, ſuch as he thought good, &amp; that the reſt ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine in their curſed ſtate. And therfore S. Paule alledgeth this place to apply it to the ſecret electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, through which before the foundation of the world, he choſe thoſe as ſeemed good vnto him. Now this is a very high and profound mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but when it ſhalbe farther declared, euery one may make his profite of it, ſo that we be attentiue vnto it. And for the remnaunt, let vs receiue that, which the holy ſcripture ſheweth vnto vs, with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brietie, &amp; let vs not deſire to be wiſer, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is lawful for vs: but let vs reſt in that which God ſhal ſpeak vnto vs, &amp; moreouer let vs be hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble, not to reply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:7669:23"/> him, nor to bring forth our fantaſies before him, as though we would pleade againſt God: but acknowledging that his iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts are bottomles: let vs not ſearch farther therein, then is permitted vnto vs. Now it behoueth that wee handle theſe things in ſuch ſort, that that which at the firſt ſhew ſemeth to be dark, be made more eaſie to vs. We haue alredy ſene that God hath choſen Abrahams ſede. Now if a man wold aſke, whye or by whom he was brought ſo to do: he ſhall not finde that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham was any worthier then others: as we haue alredy largely inough handled this matter. Lo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a priuiledge which was giuen to a certain familie, not flowing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any merite, neither for that God found any thing in their perſons, wherfore they ought to be preferred: for they were no better nor more excellent then others, but it pleaſed him ſo. Nowe, it is very true that this will be harde for vs to digeſt, if wee bring in our owne iudgement as there are a great ſort of fantaſtical heades which cannot abide this doctrine: For it ſeemeth good to them to reply againſt God: But what profite they thereby in the end? We haue alleadged that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we muſt bring with vs an humilitie, for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence that which is hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from vs. And indeed S. Paule hath well ſhewed vs this by his example. For inſtead of diſputing the matter he cryeth out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ô how wonderfull are the iudgements of God: Beholde S. Paule who was altogether amaſed, hee found himſelfe aſtoniſhed, he that had beene rapte vp aboue the heauens, he that had ſeene the ſecrets of God which was not lawful for man to vtter.
<pb facs="tcp:7669:24"/> Saint Paule then, who was (as a man would ſay) a companion of Angelles, was founde in this caſe to meruell, and to be altogether confounded: and what ſhall become of theſe Scullions, who haue ſcarcely licked with the tippe of their tongue one word of the law and Goſpel, and yet neuertheleſſe would go beyond S. Paule? And yet men ſhal find this pride in very many. But for our parte let vs returne to that which is heere ſhewed vs. <hi>O man who art thou.</hi> When therefore we will make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betwixt God and vs: who is God? within what compaſſe ſhall we incloſe him? Shall it bee within the compaſſe of our braine? And wee haue ſcarcely half an ounce of wit, and in meane ſeaſon God, who cloſeth his fiſte, to holde the whole world as a grain of duſt (as Eſay the prophet ſaith) and is not comprehended neither in heauen nor in earth, who hath an infinite power, an infinite iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and wiſdome, and who hath incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble counſayles: and yet for al that we muſt come to make him ſubiect to our fooliſh fantaſie. And whereto will this grow? Moreouer who are we? Men, (ſaith S. Paul.) By which word he meaneth, that we are nothing at all: as if he ſhould ſay, muſt it be that thou preſume ſo much, as to dare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of the bottomleſſe ſecretes of God, ſeeing thou art nothing but clay &amp; doung? And againe, what is thy vnderſtanding? Thou art full of ſinne and iniquitie, thou art a poore blinde one: and yet thou wilt that God ſhal make an account to thee: and wilt thou conclude, that if thou finde not that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:7669:24"/> which he doeth good and reaſonable, that thou mayeſt accuſe him, and muſt he needes holde vp his hande at thy barre? Nowe let vs marke this admonition in the firſt place, and let vs knowe that our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt teacheth vs, that we cannot doe amiſſe to hearken and open our eares, to enquire and ſearch after that, that it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him we ſhoulde knowe: but let vs take heede that we goe not beyonde it: For there is no rage ſo great and outragious, as when wee wil knowe more then God doeth ſhewe vs. And moreouer we ſhall haue ſpunne a faire threed if wee apply all our ſences and all our ſtudyes thereto: whether is it that wee ſhall come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This ſhall be alwayes to inwrappe vs ſo muche the more in a Labyrinth, and maze vnleſſe, wee haue the direction of God too ſhewe vs the way.</p>
               <p>Let vs therfore keepe this meane: that is to ſay, to hearken to that which God doeth propounde vnto vs: and as ſoone as hee ſhall once ſhutte his mouth, let vs haue all our vnderſtandings locked vp &amp; captiue, and let vs not enterpriſe to knowe more, then that he ſhal haue pronounced vnto vs. Nowe therefore ſee howe the ſtocke of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was choſen before al the reſt of the worlde, foraſmuch as God ſo would: but this was not yet enough: For it behoueth that his free election be yet better confirmed vnto vs. And this is it that is here ſhewed vnto vs, in the perſon of two brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For beholde Rebecca which bare Iacob &amp; Eſau: was the one better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other? S. Paule expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this place ſaith. <hi>And they were not yet beene.</hi>

                     </gap>.</note> How
<pb facs="tcp:7669:25"/> then could they haue obtayned fauour and grace before God for their merites? for Iacob had done neither good not euill no more then Eſau. Why then doth God make him the greater? It behoueth not that we enter into any deeper diſputation of this matter, vnleſſe it bee to adore with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſecret councell of God, through which, thoſe which ſeemed good to him are elected, and the other reiected. See then how God woulde yet giue greater glory &amp; beautie to his mercie, when he had choſen Iacob before Eſau. For in deede he might haue wel placed Iacob the formoſte, when the Infants ſhould coome forth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mothers wombe. Men may well vnderſtand, that this was not by any aduenture: as it is ſaid in the Pſalme: <hi>Thou haſt drawen mee out from my mothers wombe:</hi> And God manifeſteth a ſingular power, when children come into the world. And why then did not hee permit &amp; ordaine that Iacob ſhould haue the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge of birthright? For this was meete ſince he ment to baniſh Eſau out of the church, and would haue Iacob to remaine there, &amp; to ſucceede in the place of his father Iſaack and Abraham. And why doth God then pull him back, &amp; make him inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to his brother, as touching the law of nature, and afterwards ſetteth him aboue him? In this we ſee that God would ſhut out all glory of man, that he would that al height ſhould be thrown down, and that men ſhould bring nothing of their owne: to the ende to ſay: I haue attained ſuch or ſuch a good thing. I haue gotten it by mine owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie. We ſee then that which I haue already tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:7669:25"/> that is to ſaye, that wee haue heere a glaſſe, wherein we may beholde, that all they that are of the church, are not aduanced therto by their own vertue, and that they haue not obtained this fauor by their merites: but that God hath choſen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were borne: See the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> briefly what we haue to holde out of this place. But now a man might heere moue ſome dout: For Moyſes ſaith expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that this was extended to two peoples, and that it was not only in reſpect of Iacob and Eſau, that this ſtrugling combate was mooued, as touching their perſons: but that it was in reſpect of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, &amp; eche others poſteritie. Now it is ſo, that many which deſcended of Iacob were neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe reiected. For he ſtayeth vpon that that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heere: to wit, that the ſtock &amp; offspring of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was choſen and that of Eſau reiected: and yet notwithſtanding a man may ſee, that the moſt part of thoſe that deſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded of Iacob, were diſalowed of god, &amp; that he pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth them baſtard children, the children of an harlot, &amp; ſuch as were ſprong of fornication, &amp; that they belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged nothing at al vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, &amp; that it was a vain thing for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to glory or boaſt of his name. Now how can theſe agre to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither? Let vs mark that god ſetteth ſuch a ſpectacle before the eyes of Iacob &amp; Rebecca, to ſhew them what the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition &amp; ſtate of the church ſhould be: For God in few wordes teſtifieth vnto them, that his church ſhould com of Iacob: and not that all they which he ſhould beget concerning the fleſhe muſt be of the church: but it was inough that he remained there, &amp; that God kept him: &amp; that Eſau
<pb facs="tcp:7669:26"/> was driuen out in time, as afterwards we ſhall ſee. This ſhalbe better vnderſtoode by that expoſition which Saint Paule giueth: he taketh this ſentence thus:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.6.</note> 
                  <hi>All they which are of Iacob after the fleſh, are not for all that, true Iſraelites:</hi> that is to ſay, they are not of the people of God. For he had two names, as wee ſhall ſee hereaftet, to wit, Iacob &amp; Iſrael. And that it is ſo, before the children were borne, loe God, which ſeuereth the one from the other, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that this is not one body, and that they were not vnited togither: but that one was reſerued, &amp; the other reiected. S. Paule therefore wel vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode, that they which ſhould be borne of Iacob, were not all elected of God: for hee ſendeth vs to the beginning, and ſaith that the one was ſeparated from the other by the ſecret counſaile of God, &amp; that we cannot comprehend &amp; ſet foorth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof: foraſmuche (as I haue already ſaide) that hee keepeth his libertie, in ſuch ſorte that it wel ſuffiſeth that the Church be engendred of his ſtocke, albeit that all doe not appertaine vnto it. We haue before declared that there was a double grace or fauour in this ſtock of Abraham: one was, that God had in generall declared, that hee would be their father. Circumciſion alſo was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them all. Now circumciſion was not in vaine: but it bare witneſſe of the remiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſinnes and of the righteouſnes that all the faithfull muſt obtain through our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Lo the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael who was circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſed: aſmuch as was on gods behalf, he receiued the ſacrament that might aſſure him that God accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him of the number of his
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:7669:26"/> children, that he was a member of Ieſus Chriſte, that the curſſe which he had drawen from Adam, was aboliſhed: yea but this ſtoode him in no ſteed at all. Aſmuch may be ſaid of Eſau, &amp; of all their like: but howſoeuer it was, we muſt not deſpiſe the benefite that he ſhewed towardes all the ſtocke of Abraham. As at this day when wee ſpeake of the ineſtimable bleſſing that God hath beſtowed vpon vs, when his Goſpel was preached: this ſame ſhall be ſpoken vnto all indifferently. Men will ſay that God hath vſed a very ſingular mercie towards vs, in aſmuch as he hath lightened vs by his word, that we ſhould know the way of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the meane time, we ſee others that wander in darckeneſſe and confuſion, as if God had forgotten and altogither caſt them off. Beholde the Papiſts, albeit they bee ful of pride and rebellion, yet they are toſſed too &amp; fro of Sathan: ſo as they know neither way nor path: &amp; in meane time god calleth vs to him dayly, &amp; there is mention of his couenant, to the end that we ſhuld know that he is alwaies merciful vnto vs, and that we may call vpon him in a true certaintie, not douting, but that he wil be our father. Beholde then a benefite, which wee ought not to eſteeme lightly off: and yet there are a greate many, too whome this ſerueth not, but to condemnation: For there is ſomuch the more vnthankfulneſſe, if they be rebelles againſt God, and diſdain to accept the fatherly fauour that hee offered vnto them. So then, beholde ſuch a fauour already beſtowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, as that was vppon the ſtocke of Abraham:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:27"/> but yet there was alſo a ſeconde grace, the which muſt yet be reſtrained to theſe bounds: to witt, that God hath choſen of this ſtock, thoſe that hath ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good vnto him, as he receiued Iſaack to him ſelfe, and Iſmael had no place in his houſe: he might well be accounted for a time a member of his houſe: but in the end he was cut off. Aſmuch may be ſaid of the children of Keturah: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde although Eſau were the firſt borne, yet God ſhut him out. See therefore a ſecond fauour which was in Abrahams familie: that is, that God helde to himſelf, thoſe that he thought good. For Iacob was as the roote of this ſtock which ſprong after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. And farther marke for what cauſe all the elect were figured in his perſon, and that God ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth forth vnto vs, that they haue not that of them ſelues, which he through his onely goodneſſe gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vnto them, and that they cannot brag, that this was of their owne moouing, that they attay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſaluation: but that they were drawen to it, yea in aſmuch as they were choſen before the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the worlde and conſequently before their birthe. Beholde, wherefore S. Paule, in this place that we haue aledged, for the more ful declaration adioyneth the teſtimonie of Moyſes: I wil haue mercie on him on whome I wil haue mercie:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.19.</note> &amp; I wil haue compaſſion on him, on whom I wil haue compaſſion. It ſhoulde ſeeme that this is a broken ſpeech and from the purpoſe: but it is of great importaunce: For it is aſmuch as if GOD had ſayde, I knowe whome I will reſerue, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:7669:27"/> there is no neede that any come in this caſe too pleade with mee: For this conſiſteth in my liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall mark our common ſpeach, this ſhall not be darke at all. For if a man ſay, I wil doe that, I wil doe: that is to ſay, I wil doe that which I think good to do, by this he ſheweth, that he wil not ſubmit him ſelfe to any perſon: hee ſheweth that he is neither tied nor bound to open his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel &amp; purpoſe, in that he hath to do. So God ſaieth, <hi>I will ſhew mercie to him, that I wil ſhewe mercie:</hi> as if he ſhould ſay: My mercie dependeth neither vppon this or that, neither muſt the cauſe bee ſought in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, nor I bound to any lawe: For I knowe what I ought to do: &amp; in the meane time my mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie ſhall haue place, and I wil ſhewe mercie to whom I will ſhew mercie: That is to ſay: I mark not who is woorthy of it. For there is not one: But yet I will not ceaſe to ſhew mercie to ſome, to witte, to ſuch as I ſhall haue choſen. Marke then how preciſely God ſpeaketh: and this is to beate downe whatſoeuer men can alledge to ſhutte the doore againſt all curioſitie, and ſet a barre againſt all preſumption: &amp; that we doe ſimply reuerence him, leauing that to him which hee hath reſerued to himſelf: that is to ſay, when hee ſaueth, it is of his free goodnes: and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he condemneth, that we ſhoulde not enterpriſe to barke againſt God, but that we ſhut vp our mouth: vnleſſe it bee to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him. Now let vs mark that this was ſpoken by Moyſes whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the people already multiplied, &amp; after that God had brought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of Egypt. Behold a
<pb facs="tcp:7669:28"/> Church deſcended from the race of Iacob? For from this ſame barren houſe, and which was as it were deſolate, GOD had drawen ſo greate a multitud therefrom, that this ſeemed rather to bee a notorious miracle, &amp; that this promiſe was veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: that <hi>Abrahams ſeede ſhould be at the ſtarres of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Was not this in a goodly ſhewe in reſpect of men? God ſayth of this multitude heere, I wil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine as many as I ſhall think good: I will ſhewe mercy to whome I will ſhewe mercie, and let no man aſke the reaſon therof. It is true in deede that God hath reaſon, but it followeth not therefore that we can comprehend it, or that we muſt break out beyond our bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds into his ſecrets. We muſt therefore knowe that in reſpecte of vs, there is no reaſon: but the counſaile of God ought to be vnto vs in all reſpectes the rule of righteouſneſſe, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and equitie. Mark therefore how the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of S. Paule agreeth very well to that which is heere pronounced: that is to wit, that there were two peoples in the belly of Rebecca, and that fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her bowels twoo nations ſhould bee deuided: and this was aſmuch as if God had teſtified, that there ſhould be ſuch a diuorſe, that yet the ſtocke of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob ſhould remaine bleſſed: Not altogither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, but thoſe whome it ſhoulde pleaſe GOD to keepe to himſelfe, as hee had choſen them before the creation of the world. See the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſumme of that which is contayned heere. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we goe any farther, let vs wel note that which hath beene ſaide: that is to ſay, that the principall
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:7669:28"/> thing which we haue to obſerue, is this, that God will haue the whole praiſe of our ſaluation to bee attributed to him. For what is the roote &amp; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the church? It is his election. See whereto Moyſes calleth vs, yea according to the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of S. Paule: and the texte alſo heerein is moſte plaine. For heere (as I haue ſaide) there is not any queſtion of any earthly or tranſitory inheritance: it is of euerlaſting life that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had hoped for according to that he had receiued through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. Now ſee Iacob an heire: and why ſo? was it becauſe he put himſelf in the fauour of God, or for that hee had purchaſed fauour for any thing hee brought? It was not ſo. See then Moyſes text with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any gloſe, which ſheweth ſufficiently, that the Church ſpringeth from the pure grace of God: &amp; ſo that all the prayſe of our ſaluation, muſt wholly be reſerued to himſelf. Nowe, for all this, they that would ouerthrowe and darken this doctrine ſay, although that God knew no merite in Iacob: yet he foreſaw wel inough that he ſhuld be ſuch a one. Behold for what cauſe they ſay he was choſen, and Eſau reiected. To be ſhort, inaſmuch as a great ſort of thoſe Dogs dare not openly and flatly deny the election of God, they would that there ſhould be a ſuperiour cauſe, to wit, his foreknowledge. And what is that foreknowledge? It is that God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeth what manner of one euery one muſte bee: and hee choſeth (ſay they) thoſe whome hee hath foreſeene to be of a good nature and affection: and it is no maruell if he accept them before others:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:29"/> For hee knoweth the good which appeereth not yet, but is to come. But ſuch kinde of men haue no drop of the feare of God. For they manifeſtly blaſpheme againſt the holy ghoſt, who hath ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the mouth of S. Paule, and theſe mocke at that which S. Paul hath ſpoken as if it were a fable. For if a man accept their ſolution, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath S. Paul ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; vnaduiſed man: For he taketh this reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he found neither good nor euil, neither in Iſaack nor in Eſau, nor in Iacob. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding God choſe the one and reiected the other. But the reply ſhall be eaſye, in the opinion of theſe fantaſtical perſons. And how? It is true that there was neither good nor euill: but there muſt bee either good or euil, and God did ſo foreſee it. But S. Paule preſuppoſeth that this be true, to wit, that we are all damned, and that vntill that God had choſen vs, it muſt needs be that we ſhould remaine as Serpents full of venim, and that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in vs but matter of wrath &amp; of the ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geance of God, and that wee are altogither confounded, and ful of poyſon and iniquitie.</p>
               <p>Loe Iacobs caſe aſwell as Eſaus. For what ſhall wee finde in the race of Adam, but all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? Wee are therefore infected before God: and in aſmuch as the roote is accurſſed and vitious and altogither rotten, it muſte needes bee that the fruites bee of the ſame ſorte. So then when God ſhall leaue vs ſuch as wee are, it muſt needes be that we all periſh, and that there remaine not one, but that wee be all loſte and conſumed.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:7669:29"/>
               <p>To be ſhort, this doctrine is common enough in the holy Scripture, that we are all the children of wrath. It followeth then that there was no diuerſitie in Eſau and Iacob, and that God had not diſtinguiſhed the one from the other, for that hee found or foreſawe any good either in the one or other. For what could he foreſe, but this corrupted maſſe of Adam, that brings forth no other fruite but malediction? See therefore what he forſawe aſwel in the one as in the other indifferently. It followeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he had put in Iacob that which is found in him, and that he lefte Eſau ſuch a one as his birth brought him foorth. See alſo why it is ſaid in another place, <hi>That God hath choſen vs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.4.</note> 
                  <hi>to the end that we ſhould be holy &amp; vnblamable before him.</hi> He ſayth not, becauſe God foreſaw that we ſhould be holy, he hath choſen vs: but contrariwiſe he deriueth all our holyneſſe and righteouſneſſe, and all the good which ſhalbe found in vs, he deriueth it from this roote: to wit, from the election of God, to the end we ſhould walke in his feare, that we ſhould haue ſome integritie in vs, that wee ſhoulde haue ſome zeale and affection to doe well. If this be ſo, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth then that God hath foreſeene nothing in vs. For let vs take away election, and what ſhall there remaine? As we haue declared, we remaine altogither loſt and accurſed. And not without cauſe: For God ſaw nothing in vs but corruption: and it muſt needes be that he muſt diſſalowe vs, &amp; renounce vs, as it is ſaid, that he repented that hee had made man. Behold then what we may alledge
<pb facs="tcp:7669:30"/> on our part. So then, this is too tryfling a folly to ſay, that God hath choſen his, according as he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſawe they ſhould become afterwardes: for it muſt needes be, that he put in them, that which is good, and place it there, becauſe hee hath choſen them. Marke therefore the firſt ſtep whereby wee muſt begin: that is to ſay, that wee nothing differ one from another, vnleſſe in this, that God hath diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs. Mark alſo for what cauſe S. Paule diſſanul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth all the glory the which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may vſurpe: Who is it (ſaith he) that doth diſcerne thee? hee hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this word there to beate downe &amp; diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nul all pride. And why ſo? For haſt thou any thing (ſaith he) which is thine owne? Heereby hee ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that men cannot chuſe their owne place, to ſay, I will diſpoſe my ſelfe to doe good, &amp; God ſhall haue pitie vpon me, and I wil com vnto his grace, I will haue a good motion, I will haue this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Now S. Paule excludeth all this, in ſaying that we are all loſt, that one with another, we muſt be all throwen downe, and enter into the gulfe of hel, except it pleaſe God to diſcerne vs. Loe from whence all our dignitie and excellencie commeth: that is, for that it pleaſeth God to lend vs his hand. Againe let vs holde faſt this principle, and apply all this doctrine which we haue rehearſed to this purpoſe, how God hath ſet forth vnto vs, in Iacob &amp; Eſau, a glaſſe to looke into. Likewiſe let vs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelues, that theſe two perſones may bee vnto vs, as two liuely images, to ſhew vs that the worlde in it ſelfe, is of like condition: but that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7669:30"/> one ſort is called and not the other becauſe it hath ſo pleaſed God. And ſpecially (as I haue noted) Iacob was the you<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, &amp; it ſeemed rather that hee ſhould be ſubiect to his brother, according to the order of nature: notwtihſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding mark that he was placed in the degre of the firſt borne and Eſau not onely was put vnder him, but he was vtterly reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: For in the end he had no part nor portion in the church. This thing ſheweth very wel vnto vs, that God would holde vs alwayes conuicted, that there is no queſtion of bringing any thing before God on our parte, to thruſt in our ſelues there, as if we had any valure and woorthyneſſe in vs: For God is not contrary to himſelfe: neuertheleſſe he would ſhew heere a certaine kinde of repugnancie and contraryetie. It is he which ordayned that the firſt borne of the houſe, ſhould be the head. Nowe he ſet downe this lawe: and yet in the meane time he ouerthroweth it: but (as I haue ſayd) all this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth very wel: For God is aboue his ordinary law, &amp; yet he wold change that which was accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed by a common rule: &amp; he doth it to the end that we ſhould knowe that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> (as S. Paule al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo hath ſaid) neither of the willer, nor of the ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner:<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> but onely of him which ſheweth mercie. Nowe when S. Paule ſaith, that it is neither of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth: hee meaneth not that wee may haue ſome good will of our ſelues: as he hath declared in another place:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</note> For <hi>it is God which giueth it:</hi> and alſo hee meaneth not that we can inforce our ſelues but he ſheweth that men
<pb facs="tcp:7669:31"/> haue nothing; and therefore they can bring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God.</p>
               <p>There is nothing then but his mercye alone. For if men had any thing to ſette againſt it, there muſt bee a parting of ſtakes, and that muſt bee knowen which is from God, and that which is from men. And then it might bee ſaid, that wee haue not all from the onely mercie of God: but that therein there is our good will, our good run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and our good zeale. Men might ſo ſpeake: But Sainte Paule woulde heere make fruſtrate, whatſoeuer men might bringe of them ſelues, and ſhewe that nothing hath dominion heerein, but the onely mercy of GOD. It is very true that many people will inforce them ſelues, yea and they alledge the example of the Iewes, who were ſwolne as Todes with a diueliſh kinde of pride, thinking that God was bound as it were to them, and who would bee accounted righteous accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their woorkes: but heerein they deceiue them ſelues, and ſhall doe nothing but goe backe in ſteade of going forwarde. When men preſume ſo of them ſelues, it is certaine that they rob God of his honour. See then theſe ſacrilegious perſons and worſe then theeues, and moreouer vntill God ſhall haue renued vs, whatſoeuer goodly ſhew we haue, it is certaine, that there is nothing in vs but ſtinch, and wee ſhall bee as vile vermine before GOD.</p>
               <p>So then let vs not pretende that we can either will or runne: but it behooueth that God finde vs
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7669:31"/> as loſt, and that hee recouer vs from that bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pitte, and that hee ſeparate vs from them with whome wee were loſt, and to whome wee were alike. For (as I haue ſayde) the condition of mankinde is all one. It is true, that the one ſorte, are the Children of wrath, and the other God bleſſeth. But from whence commeth this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and this diuorſe? From mercie. And wee muſt not goe to enquire any farther, but wee muſt content our ſelues with this worde alone, in ſtead of all reaſon.</p>
               <p>Marke then for what cauſe, namely the firſt-borne was caſte out from his place: and in the meane ſeaſon Iacob who was the inferiour, was ſet in his place, yea, to remaine the onely heyre. When Malachie the Prophet ſpeaketh of this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mala.</hi> 1.2.</note> he reprocheth vnto the Iewes their ingratitude. It is true that this was for an outwarde ſigne, that GOD had choſen Iacob rather then Eſau, for aſmuche as hee had giuen the lande of Canaan to be his inheritance, and that Eſau was ſent farre off amiddeſt the Mountaynes: but this is not the ſentence wherevppon the Prophete reſteth: hee looketh vnto a thing much higher.</p>
               <p>Saint Paule alſo when hee vſeth this teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of his, ſeeing that GOD had taken vnto him ſelfe the ſtocke of Iacob, hee attributeth all this to his meere mercie: But the Prophet ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. And Eſau, was hee not the brother of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob? As if hee ſhoulde ſay. You are ful of pryde and obſtinacie, yea, you burſt your ſelues therein,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:32"/> and it coſtes you nothing to ſay, ô we are of the holy &amp; ſacred ſtocke of Abraham: wee are the Church, we are the people whome God hath ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed and ſanctified: yea, &amp; from whence haue you this (ſaith he?) For was not Eſau, Iacobs brother? You ſee the Idumeans your brethren: &amp; are they the people of God? you ſay that they are ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from the Church: &amp; although they haue cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, yet notwithſtanding God hath cut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> off. And whence commeth this (ſaith hee?) Who is it that hath ſo ſeparated them? If you will goe from age to age: very well, you ſhall finde howe you are the Children of Iacob. And Eſau, whoſe childe was he I pray you? Did not he diſcend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Abraham and Iſaack aſwel as you? But heere hee ſpeaketh not onely of the land of Canaan: but hee goeth farther, and ſayth <hi>That hee loued Iacob, &amp; hated Eſau.</hi> And this loue which he bare vnto Iacob, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence proceeded it? It is certaine that Iacob could not be accepted of him (as we haue ſaid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered in himſelf. For behold him the child of wrath, &amp; bringing nothing from the wombe of his mother, but this horrible curſſe, which was caſt vpon all mankind: notwithſtanding God did loue him. Now God loueth not iniquitie, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth ſinne as we know. How the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loued he Iacob? This was for that he drew him from that perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherin he was. And why did he hate Eſau? Nowe it is very true that there is iuſte cauſe why God ſhould hate all mankinde: For as wee haue ſaid, there is nothing in vs but vice and iniquitie:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:7669:32"/> but yet when wee will goe farther, and that wee will demaunde, why God before hee created the worlde, and before the fall of Adam, why this ſhoulde be, that hee would hate or loue? heere we muſt holde our ſelues mute and ſtill: Heere wee muſt not lifte vp our hornes. For what ſhall wee gaine, when we will enter into debate and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God? It is certaine that wee ſhall caſt ſtones vppon our owne heades, and they will fall neither heere nor there, they cannot reach vnto the maieſtie of God: but they ſhall returne vppon our owne pates, and it muſt be that we be cruſſhed and bruſed therewith.</p>
               <p>Beholde then what wee ſhall gaine when wee open our throte, to caſte foorth blaſphemyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: For we ſhall but caſt out our dartes &amp; ſtones into the ayre: but they ſhall not reach vnto him, it ſhalbe rather that we be pearced and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them, and that we remaine confounded in that our raſhneſſe and ouerweening. Thus, let vs content our ſelues with that which God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that is to ſay: that hee hath hated Eſau and loued Iacob. Now by this the Children of Iacob were aſwell conuinced, that they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereof they might glory in them ſelues, and that there reſted nothing, but that they made an acknowledgement vnto God of ſuch a liberall and bountiful goodneſſe which hee had vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes them, and whereof none coulde finde any reaſon, vnleſſe in this that it ſo pleaſed him. But notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding they were ful of impietie againſt
<pb facs="tcp:7669:33" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, and woulde holde this priuiledge: but God ſheweth them, that it doth not belong vnto them, and that if they accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted him for their father, they muſt be his children. But heereby we are admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that although our ſaluation proceede from the only grace of God, and that therin it conſiſteth to the ende: Notwithſtanding it followeth not, that vnder the ſhadowe heereof, wee can let looſe our ſelues to euill, and giue ouer our ſelues therto. But there are villaines &amp; dogges that barke againſt God, &amp; there are alſo Hogges, which ouerthrow this doctrine of election, by their looſe and lewde life. For there are two ſortes of people, that are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemyes to this doctrine. The one are as dogges, &amp; the other as Hogges. The one, which are they? they which will and come to ſhewe their teeth, and who deſpite God by their wicked queſtions: as wee ſee at this day in thoſe villaines who make no ſcruple, to rend in peeces all the holy Scripture to corrupt, peruert, falſifie &amp; adulterate all, ſo that they may darken the election of God, to witte, to make nothing of all. And marke whervnto this te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth, to make this doctrine odious. For they wil ſay, that they that thus ſpeake, they put no more any difference betwixt good and euil, &amp; that God by this meane ſhoulde become vnrighteouſe, if he ſhould put any difference betweene one and an other, &amp; that there ſhould bee acceptaunce of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones in him. Beholde then the dogges that barke and whet their teeth againſt this doctrine. Nowe there are alſo Hogs which will not deſpite in ſuch
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:7669:33"/> ſorte againſt it, but wil ſay, very wel. If I be elected I may do as much euil as I wil: For God knowes wel how to keepe me, and I can neuer periſh: and contrarywiſe if I be reprobate, why ſhoulde I tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my ſelfe ſo much to doe well, ſeeing that I can neuer be ſaued. Theſe then (as I haue already ſayd) come not to ſpue vp their contradictions, to ouerthrowe the trueth of God: but they wallowe there, and remayne in their ſinnes as brute beaſtes. But wee muſt take heede bothe of the one and the other And for this cauſe (as I haue ſaide) the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet Malachie ſhewing to the people, that all that he had done vnto them, came of the meere &amp; free bountie of God, exhorteth them to holyneſſe of life. And therefore as it is ſaid vnto vs, that God is the author of our ſaluation, and that we can bring nothing to ſerue in that matter, and that yet wee muſt alwayes be kept vnder his garde, and that hee muſt perfect &amp; accompliſh that which he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, let not this bee to the ende, to let looſe the brydle to our vices: but rather to keepe vs in his feare.</p>
               <p>And in very deede when S. Paule ſaith, that theſe are the hidden letters, &amp; that it is an inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſecret, to knowe who be the children of God, hee addeth: <hi>Whoſoeuer calleth vppon the name of God, let him departe from all iniquitie.</hi> Let vs marke then, that GOD woulde giue vs no occaſion to doe euill, when hee choſe vs without any regarde to our merites, and that hee alſo maintaineth vs
<pb facs="tcp:7669:34"/> by his meere goodneſſe: but this is to the end that we ſhould honour him, and we ſhould walke in ſo much the greater carefulneſſe. And therefore let vs returne to that we haue touched: to wit, that he hath choſen vs, to the ende that wee ſhoulde bee holy and without blame before his face. It is true that he hath not choſen vs, for that he found vs ſuch: but when he choſe vs, it was to the end we ſhould be ſuch. It behoueth therefore that we march thither, and that this be the Mark that wee aime at all the dayes of our life.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs fall downe before the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of our good GOD, in acknowledging of our faultes, praying him that he will in ſuch ſorte make vs to feele them, that it may bee to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs, and to drawe vs to true repentaunce, to the ende, we may renounce all our fleſhly luſtes and affections: and that beeing ſo caſt downe in our ſelues, wee may bee enlightened by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of his holy ſpirite, to the ende to ſerue and honour him all the time of our life: and that by this meanes wee may ſo much the more bee ſtyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp to giue our ſelues wholly to him, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we holde all of his meere goodneſſe: and that this may bee to glorifie his holy name, not onely in mouth but in our whole life.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a thinge that much troubleth mens ſpirites, when they ſee the eſtate of the worlde ſo confuſed, that the moſte parte doe manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſpite God, and it ſeemeth that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſpired with the deuill, to the end to giue ouer them ſelues to all miſchiefe. For this is thought a thing greatly againſt reaſon, that GOD ſhould create men to deſtroy them. Wherfore then is it, that he ſuffereth the greateſt number ſo to fall? If it bee ſaide that this ought to bee imputed not to God, but to thoſe that of their owne accorde throwe them ſelues ſo to perdition, yet this maketh no whit to the appeaſing of thoſe troubles, that we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue: For could not God remedie it? Why is it then that he doeth it not? They that alleadge a ſimple permiſſion, that God layeth the bridle vpon euery mans necke, and that euery one guideth himſelf according to his owne free will: yet they cannot well vndoe this knot: to witte, why God hath not created men of another
<pb facs="tcp:7669:35"/> ſorte: and wherefore hee hath ſuffered that they ſhould be ſo weake, yea and enclyned to euill and corruption: and ſeeing that hee knewe their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, wherefore is it, that hee doth not help them and prouide them ſome remedie? This therefore is to entangle our ſelues in great torments &amp; trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. But it behoueth that we goe yet farther: For it is certaine (as the Scripture declareth) that there is nothing which doeth not periſhe, ſauing that which God preſerueth through his meere good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and free bountie. But now, how commeth it to paſſe, that God choſeth onely the tenth or the hundreth parte of men, and leaueth all the reſt, knowing well that they are ſwallowed vp in hell and loſt? Wherefore doeth he not reach out his hand to helpe them, yea why hath hee ordayned them to deſtruction, as the Scripture ſpeaketh? For marke the very woordes of Solomon: Beholde a ſentence, which driueth vs from ſuch hard queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and many are therein entangled, as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thornes: And further they thruſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ſo farre, that they are altogither confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But yet there is a tentation farre greater. For beſides that generalitie of the worlde, the like is ſeene alſo in the Church: that is, that when the Goſpel hath beene preached to a whole people, there are then many Hypocrites, the others are rebels, others become wholly brutiſh, in ſuch ſort that they profite but very little in this ſchoole, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God note all without exception to whom he ſpeaketh. And beyond all theſe, a man ſhall finde
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:7669:35"/> many, who through conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt &amp; ingratitud wil ſhut againſt themſelues the gate of ſaluation, &amp; will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect all the graces of God: and not onely this: but men ſhall finde deadly enemies of the doctrine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be of the houſhold, And in very deed the prophet Eſay hauing ſaid, that god wold gather his church out of the world, &amp; that he wold haue ſo great a people as ſhould be wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derful, in ſtead of reioycing, he afterwards addeth: Alas my bowels. Now by this he ſheweth, that when it ſhall ſeeme that all muſt flouriſh &amp; proſper, &amp; that God muſt be glorified both of great &amp; ſmall, &amp; that his ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner muſt be diſplaied, to gather togither the whole world, to the ende that with one accorde all may ſerue God: then he diſcouereth a ſecret miſchiefe. For the Prophet cryeth not onely alas the hands, alas the legges: but he cryeth out, alas my bowels, as though he would ſay, this miſchiefe is ſo rooted in the church, that it muſt be as it were mingled of ſo ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dry ſortes of men, that ſhe muſt nouriſh in her owne belly her own enemies, as we haue ſeene by the figure in Rebecca. Now what is to bee doone therin? Euery one ſeeth that if we enter into ſuch fantaſies, we cannot haue any reſolution, &amp; the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil wil thruſt in himſelfe amongſt, to the ende to make vs blaſpheme againſt God, or elſe to put ſuch a bitterneſſe into our heart, that we ſhal ſeeme rather to be blocks of wood, then reſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures formed according to Gods image: as we do ſee the experience therof in many people, who do beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e as it were mad &amp; raging againſt god, becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not rid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues from difficulties &amp; douts.
<pb facs="tcp:7669:36"/> It is neceſſary therefore to ſearch out a remedie. Now it is true that we cannot exempt fully our ſelues from all paſſions, that at the firſt bluſh and as it were with ſome puffe wee bee not mooued and troubled, and that our thoughts doe not wander, that we do not conceiue many thinges at randon, and that wee haue not many diſputes, bothe on the one ſide and on the other: to be ſhorte, that wee be not toſſed, as if there were ſome kinde of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt &amp; whirlewind, which carryed vs about. We can not haue our ſpirites altogither quiet, nor ſo well guyded, that they ſhall haue no troubles. And this is declared vnto vs in Rebecca, when ſhee ſayeth.</p>
               <q>If it bee ſo, to what end I? or why doe I liue?</q>
               <p>She deſireth death, and yet ſhee is the mother of the faithfull? Shee repreſenteth the Church. Now if this were in her, that bare in her belly the hope of the ſaluation of the worlde: what ſhalbe in vs? So conſidering that we haue our mindes ſo ready to conceiue follyes and vanities, and moreouer ſo ready alſo to caſt vs off the hinges, &amp; in the end ſo ſubiect to make vs ſtorme againſt God, ſo much the rather it ſtandeth vs in hande to ſearch out the remedy. Now that is heere giuen vs in Rebecca: For ſhe fodes not her ſelfe in her ſadneſſe, ſhee by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not vpon the brydle, as many doe who ſticke there, which ſeeke to haue no meane wherein to content themſelues, nor to make them quiet &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but they wander this way and that way, and alwayes adde fantaſies to fantaſies, &amp; plunge them
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:7669:36"/> ſelues ſo deepe in their imaginations, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill afterwards poſſeſſeth them, and driueth them by all violence and fury againſt God. Rebecca doth not ſo: But when ſhe felt that this was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable greefe vnto her, ſhe withdraweth her ſelf vnto God, ſhe enquireth of him, and anſwere was giuen vnto her by and by. She had therfore wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon to reſt her ſelfe, when ſhe knewe that ſo was the good pleaſure of GOD: and when ſhee ſawe what hee demaundeth: and that one of her owne children ſhould bee cut off from the Church, and the other reſerued, ſhee knowing this, it behoueth that ſhe reſt there and ſubmit her ſelfe thervnto: the which thing ſhe doth. For ſhe ſtriueth not againſt God. Likewiſe we read not that at any time after ſhe murmured: but we ſee that ſhe hearkened vnto God: and brought forth children afterwards, and alwayes ſhe reſted her ſelfe in that which had bene ſaid vnto her, and ſet her minde and affection vpon Iacob. And why ſo? Becauſe ſhe knewe that hee was ordained of God to be the bleſſed ſeed, which ſhe had hoped for: ſo as ſhe behaued her ſelf more manfully in this reſpect, then Iſaack her huſband. Now this is to ſhew vs, that when wee are in any trouble, wee muſt ſtraightway haue our recourſe to God. For our ſpirits are not able enough, too knowe theſe hidden things: yea wee ſee that in the moſte eaſyeſt things in the world (as ſeemeth vnto vs) we ſhalbe many times rauiſhed &amp; aſtoniſhed. And what ſhal it be then, when the queſtion ſhalbe of the iudgements of God, which are incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:37"/> and which are of ſo high and profounde matter, that the holy Ghoſte teacheth vs, in ſteade of curious ſearching after the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we muſt adore them? ſhall men preſume of their reaſon, &amp; of that they ſhall builde vpon their good lyking, and ſhall they examine all after their owne fantaſie and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion? It is certain that ſuch preſumption ſhall not remaine vnpuniſhed: &amp; it is ſeene alſo. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it, that ſo many dogges at this day ſpue out their blaſphemies againſt this doctrine of prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination? It is becauſe they vouchſafe not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at the mouth of God, but they wil giue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence as their braine wil beare, forſooth as though we were fit and ſufficient. So then let vs followe the example of Rebecca: that is to ſay, when all theſe queſtlons ſhall come before our eyes, and that we ſhall be tormented on euery ſide, in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And how is it poſſible that the moſte parte of the world ſhall periſh, and the reſt be ſaued? Howe commeth it to paſſe, that one is elected and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother reiected? Howe is it that the greateſte number goe to deſtruction, and that there is but an handfull of people which God reſerueth to him ſelfe?</p>
               <p>When we ſhall bee thus tormented, let vs haue recourſe vnto God: that is to ſay, let vs hearken to that which is ſhewed vs in the holy Scripture, let vs pray God that hee will open our eares and our eyes, to the ende we may vnderſtand his will. And farther haue wee this? It behoueth vs altogither to reſt therein, and to bee quiet. For there is no
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:7669:37"/> cauſe of diſputing any farther, when God hath once pronounced his ſentence. To be ſhort, this is dayly to ſhewe vs, that wee can not euer diſpoſe our ſelues, to receiue the inſtruction of the holy Scripture, and to ſeeke all our wiſedome there, vnleſſe we haue this modeſtie and humilitie in vs, not to deſire to vnderſtand or knowe any thinge, but that which is contayned therein. Wee neede not any reuelation from heauen at this day, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca had. It is very true that ſome coniectured that ſhe went vnto ſome Prophet: but they were thin ſowen in the worlde then. For a man may eaſily perceiue that Melchezedech was dead: and that there was not any moe then Abraham and Iſaack.</p>
               <p>This then is a Dreame, to thinke that ſhee went to the ſchooles of the Prophets: but ſhe had a reuelation, as our text heere ſheweth. And our condition at this day is not altogither like, and neither haue we alſo ſuch neede thereof. For then there was neither the Lawe nor the Goſpel. At this day wee haue all perfection of doctrine: For <hi>God in olde time hath ſpoken vnto our Fathers, and not in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete, nor in obſcuritie</hi> (as ſayeth Eſaie the Prophet.)</p>
               <p>And this was not in vaine that hee ſayde, that men ſhould ſeeke him: as Moyſes proteſteth: <hi>Beholde the way, walke in the ſame: I haue ſette before you this day, the waye of ſaluation, and Heauen and Earth are witneſſes vnto mee, that I haue declared vnto you what you muſte doe, to come vnto euerlaſting life.</hi> And
<pb facs="tcp:7669:38"/> afterwardes although God haue his ſecretes (ſaith he in an other place) yet notwithſtanding this, that is to ſay the ſumme of the lawe, is for you and for your children: to the ende that you ſhoulde bee taught in the way of ſaluation. But beſides this wee haue yet the Goſpel, wherein our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath ſhined vnto vs in all fulneſſe: For he is that ſonne of righteouſneſſe. Seeing therefore wee haue ſo ſufficient teſtimonyes, ſhall we demaunde that Angels come downe from Heauen, and that God will yet open vnto vs that is hidden from vs? But let vs (as I haue already ſaid) content our ſelues with the holy Scripture. And when there is any cauſe of inquiring after God, if we will haue him for our maiſter, let vs come to the holy Scripture: &amp; let vs remember that which Moyſes ſaith: <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſay, Who is he that ſhall aſcend aboue the Cloudes? Who is he that ſhall deſcend into the deapth? Who is hee that ſhall goe ouer the ſea? The worde of the Lord is in thy heart, and in thy mouth, ſaith he.</hi> And ſeeing it is ſo that Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes hath proteſted this in his time: at this day wee haue leſſe occaſion to wander heere and there, and to runne at all aduenture to inquire after the will of God. For (as I haue already ſayd) the Goſpel contayneth all perfection of doctrine: and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde the onely meane, whereby we may bee tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſatiſfyed, and haue our mindes ſetled and ſtayed: that is to ſay, that we hearken to God ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and ſhew our ſelues teachable, to receiue that which he ſhall ſay. For it is certaine, that as he hath anſwered to our mother Rebecca, that which hee
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:7669:38" rendition="simple:additions"/> knew to bee expedient: So the Scripture likewiſe will not deceiue in this poynt: for it pronounceth cleerely and manifeſtly, that God hath choſen vs in Ieſus Chriſt before the creation of the worlde, according to his good pleaſure, the which hee hath purpoſed in himſelfe. There needes no gloſe: beholde God ſpeaketh after this ſort, that the moſt rude and ignorant may know, what there is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned therin. God then hath choſen vs (ſaieth S. Paule) and heereby he ſheweth that he hath diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs from thoſe which periſh. And mark howe his mercie towards vs hath the greater glory. For what letted that wee ſhoulde not remaine in the ſame perdition that others did, but that God was mercifull vnto vs, without any deferre of ours?</p>
               <p>But the better to expreſſe all, Saint Paule ſayth, that he did chuſe vs in Ieſus Chriſte: it followeth then that this is out of our perſons. If we had byn choſen in our ſelues, God ſhould haue found ſome matter in vs to haue bene induced to loue vs, and to haue beene enclined to haue called vs to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But what? Wee are choſen without our ſelues: that is to ſay: God had no regarde to that we were or might be, but our election is founded in Ieſus Chriſt. And moreouer, hee yet giueth a more ample declaration: that is, according to his good purpoſe, which he had determined in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: it is certaine that all that is according to the purpoſe of man, is manifeſtly excluded: and again when he ſayth in himſelfe: this is to admoniſh vs, that if we would knowe the cauſe why: it is as if
<pb facs="tcp:7669:39"/> wee would make an Anatomie of God, and goe euen into his hart &amp; ſound all his ſecrets. And can we do thus? What ouerweening is this? So then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal ſuffer our ſelues to be taught of God, it is certaine, that he will anſwere vs, in ſuch ſorte, as ſhalbe neceſſary for vs, concerning that which belongeth to our ſaluation: and namely wee ſhall know that which ſurmounteth all mans vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, howe the one ſorte are elected, and the other reiected, and why the one haue no doctrine, as the Papiſtes and other infidels, whom God leaueth as poore blinde ones, &amp; why the other are enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the Goſpel. And farther, concerning thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached, the one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it with obedience, &amp; they are touched ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the quick, and perſeuer in it to the end: &amp; the other remaine blockiſh, or rather will be ful of outrage, to ſtriue againſt God: or elſe will be fickle and giue them ſelues ouer to all iniquitie, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the yoke, when they ſhall bee brought into the good way. And fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth this diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie? We muſt come to this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain that the holy ſcripture ſheweth vs: that is, that the like grace hath not byn ſhewed to all. So then, beholde our true wiſdome that is, that we be Gods good ſcholers: &amp; we ſhall then be hisſcholers, when we ſeeke to know nothing, but that he knoweth to be good &amp; expedient for our ſaluation: and when we ſhal reſt there, &amp; learne to bring into captiuitie all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, &amp; to keepe an hard hand vppon them. Then (ſay I) if we ſhall ſpeake of the ſecrete election of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7669:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, howe hee hath predeſtinated theſe whome hee would to ſaluation, and howe he hath caſt off others: we ſhal neuer be troubled. And why ſo? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we hauing inquired of Gods wil, we wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that we muſt keepe ourſelues to that which ſheweth vs, &amp; to that which the ſcripture impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, where he hath giuen vs ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t teſtimonie of that which he knoweth to be good for vs. Finally, there are ſo many teſtimonies of Scripture, to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs of this doctrin that it muſt needes be, that all they that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not reſt there, muſt be as it were impoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned of ſathan, &amp; that they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceued the ſpirit of venim, of pride and rebellion, to the end not to be ordred vnder the wil of god: &amp; that, to be ſhort, they would deſpite all doctrine and inſtruction, and cloſe vp their eyes againſt the ful light, &amp; haue their eares ſtopped, albeit God hath ſpoken loude and cleerely, and that they haue occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelues ſomuch the more. To heape vp all the teſtimonyes, is not needefull: but this is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that we haue had a ſumme, yea moſte euident as I haue already briefely ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Againe we haue alſo, whereof to bleſſe God &amp; to comforte our ſelues in him, when wee knowe rightly to apply this doctrine as it behoueth. For in ſtead that theſe fantaſticall &amp; lightbraynes, who would ſeeme to bee ſo ſubtile &amp; ſharpe in fighting againſt god, &amp; againſt his trueth, in ſtead that they ſearch how they may gainſay him, we muſt mark how God doth ſatiſfie vs, and to what end he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth this doctrine &amp; to what purpoſe he would
<pb facs="tcp:7669:40"/> haue it ſerue vs, that is to knowe that wee are elected, and not all. For in the firſt place, when we ſee, that we cannot receiue the Goſpel, vnleſſe it be by the ſpeciall gift of God, this ſerueth to make vs ſo much the more to magnifie his goodneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and to ſee his iuſt iudgement againſt the reprobate, when hee depriueth them of this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: as wee ſee in the Papacy, that men are as brute beaſts, who erre &amp; wander through deſerts, without keeping way or path. Now concerning vs, wee haue a ſure teſtimonie, which ought ſo much the more to ſtirre vs vp to eſteeme this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular grace towards vs. And alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>we ſee ſome that haue deafe eares, although it bee dayly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto them familiarly, and that which is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite for their ſaluation bee (as I may ſay) chawed vnto them, they continue alwaies in their eſtate: or rather they are not a whitte touched, &amp; they paſſe not to giue ouer themſelues to al licenciouſnes of life, as it were in deſpite of God: When wee ſee this, it is certaine, that our Lord hath ſo much the more bound vs vnto him, for that it hath pleaſed him to make vs feele his goodneſſe, and that wee haue taken ſuche a taſte of the hope of ſaluation which he hath propounded vnto vs: that we haue renounced the worlde and whatſoeuer weakenes ther be in vs, howſoeuer we are ful of vices and corruption, neuertheleſſe wee hate the euill that is in vs, &amp; we delight in that which is good. When then we haue this: it is certaine, that if wee be not harder then yron and ſteele, wee ought to haue all
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:7669:40"/> rebellion ſhiuered and broken: and that we bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with the loue of God, &amp; haue our mouth open to bleſſe and prayſe that ſo excellent &amp; mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent grace, which he hath ſhewed towards vs. See then the marke that the ſcripture ſetteth before vs. Now in the meane time, theſe varletes will not ſticke to ſay. O ſhall God bee an accepter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Forſooth as if God regarded in his election rich or poore, as if he regarded a noble man, more then a poore man, or a wiſe man more then an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diot. For marke what it is to accept perſons. This word <hi>Perſon</hi> in the holy ſcripture importeth <hi>Looke</hi> or <hi>countenaunce,</hi> as alſo the Scripture vſeth it. But God chooſeth vs not for our fayre eyes. Who is it that diſcerned thee? wee alleadged yeſterday that of S. Paule: When God therefore chooſeth theſe whom it pleaſed him, it is in his euerlaſting councell, and in him ſelfe: that is to ſay, he hath his ſecrets which we ought to reuerence, without far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inquiry why ſeeing this is ſo, it is certain that we cannot ſay, that he accepteth perſons. And they which ſo ſpeake are doltes, beſides the malice that is in them. Now then they will ſay, And how is it that the one ſhalbe ſaued by faith and not the other, if all depend vpon the election of God? But yet heerein they ſhew to groſſe beaſtlyneſſe: For from whence proceedeth faith it ſelfe, but from the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of God? They ſay, ô the promiſes of God are generall, and God calleth all the world to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: It followeth therefore that all the worlde ſhalbe ſaued. Yea he would that al the world ſhuld be ſaued: but this is to make the reprobate inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.
<pb facs="tcp:7669:41" rendition="simple:additions"/> For the promiſes of God do vndoutedly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſaluation: and wee ſhall not be deceiued leaning vpon them. But what? We muſt knowe from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the faith is which we haue. For when the goſpel is preached, why is it, that one ſort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite therin, &amp; receiue it with due reuerence, &amp; hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of hart, &amp; the other doe not, but rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe by it? This is, foraſmuch as they which were ordained to ſaluation (ſaith S. Luke ſpeaking of the preaching of S. Paule) they (ſaith he) did beleeue. Marke S. Paul who preached: it is certain that if euer there were dexteritie in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teacher, it was S. Paule that had it: and yet, all were not good ſcholers: there was but one parte that receued his doctrin. Whence came this? was it of their induſtrie? was it becauſe they were euill diſpoſed? It is very true that God diſpoſeth: But that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not from them, S. Luke ſheweth &amp; preuenteth heere al mens dotages, and ſaith that they which were ordained to ſaluation beleeued. And mark alſo wherfore our Lord Ieſus Chriſte ſaith: <hi>That thoſe that his heauenly father had giuen him, ſhoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not periſhe, but that he would keepe them to the ende.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when he ſaith, they which are giuen mee of my father: he calleth vs to that eternal election. He ſayeth alſo in an other place: <hi>Thine they were, &amp; thou gaueſt them vnto me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17.</note> And wherfore is it that the one belong vnto God &amp; not the other? This is not in reſpect that they are mortall men: For our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is alike: we are all created by one father: but the one belongeth vnto God, and the other are caſt off from him, becauſe it ſo pleaſed him. Hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth and accepteth the one for his owne:
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:7669:41"/> &amp; the other although they be his creatures, neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles they haue no acquainta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with him: he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth them not of his houſhold, in aſmuch as he hath ſhut them out from his election. We ſe then heere, how faith is a ſpeciall gifte of God, which proceedeth not from our free wil, not that we can of our ſelues goe forward, and that ſome are more able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend then others: but for that it hath pleaſed God to reueale his ſecrets to thoſe whome he hath elected. And therfore ſee alſo why it is ſaid in Eſaie: <hi>Who is he that will beleeue our hearing?</hi> For Eſay<note place="margin">Eſay. 53.</note> had preached of the death and reſurrection of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: as if he had deſplayed the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to declare that euery one ſhould come to bee reconcyled to God, &amp; that poore ſinners ſhould be receiued to mercy, that their ſatiſfaction &amp; righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes is altogither redy, &amp; that God deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to bee mercifull to thoſe that ſeeke him: hath Eſay preached ſo? but he crieth out forthwith <hi>Who will beleeue our hearing?</hi> And why ſo? For he ſaw in ſpirit the preſumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; rebellion of vnbeleuers, becauſe they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not yeeld the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to be ordred by God: but are wild &amp; haue always their mouth ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to reply againſt God: &amp; forthwith they haue a wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring fa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taſie they may not obay. He ſheweth that his doctrin ſhal not be receiued of the greateſt nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and addeth the reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that the arme of god, that is to ſay, his ſtrength &amp; power is not reueled to al: he ſheweth there that it is not in our ſelues that we haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:7669:42"/> generall: it muſt followe then that faith commeth from this roote of the election of God. Now tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reſt when wee ſhall haue knowne this, there is no queſtion, that wee ſhould bury all that inſtruction which our Lord hath giuen vs in the holy Scripture. For after that he hath declared to vs his will, he exhorteth vs, he reprooueth vs, hee threateneth vs. If we were as theſe rennagate ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which ſay: To what purpoſe do you preach ſo much vnto vs: If God haue elected and choſen vs vnto himſelfe, we cannot periſh: and if we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, what ſhall all the doctrine, that ſhall euer be heard auayle vs? yea, but all agreeth very well, when we exceede not our bounds. We haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſayd, that faith co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth from election. Then like as God hath choſen vs, ſo alſo he calleth vs in time, as afterwards ſhalbe handled more at large. For the place wil ſerue there more fitly. But howe ſoeuer it bee, God is not contrary to himſelfe: and like as he teſtifieth vnto vs, that it is by his free mercy, that he enlighteneth vs by the faith of his Goſpel, and in the knowledge of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt: ſo wil he that we walk in feare &amp; careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that we be touched with his threatnings, that we be gathered vnto him: al this he willeth. And in deed, mark theſe two ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, that men with their impudencie &amp; raſhnes would weene to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and neuertheles they agree very well one with the other.<note place="margin">Matt. 11.</note> Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Come vnto me all you that labour and are heauy loaden, &amp; I wil refreſh you, &amp; you ſhall finde reſt to your ſoules.</hi> See howe wee are all bidden by the ſonne of God, &amp; not only two or three, but
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:7669:42"/> all in generall: For hee ſayth: <hi>Come all you that are heauy loaden,</hi> and yet in another place hee ſaieth: <hi>No man can come vnto mee, except it be giuen him of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> None therefore can come vnto Ieſus Chriſt, vnleſſe he be drawen by the heauenly father. It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that this is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, yea he that would iudge thereof according to mans reaſon: to ſay, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt inuiteth vs all vnto him: and further addeth, that none can come vnto him, vnleſſe the father drawe him. Very wel: but (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) when God generally ſetteth ſaluation before vs in Ieſus Chriſte his onely ſonne, it is to make the reprobate ſo much the more inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their vnthankfulnes, inaſmuch as they haue deſpiſed ſo great a benefite: in the meane ſeaſon the elect are touched, and God doth not onely ſpeake outwardly to them, but alſo inwardly. And ſee why in another place our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Whoſoeuer hath beene taught of God my father, the ſame ſhal come vnto me.</hi> But, as I haue ſayd, when the Goſpel is preached in the name of God, this is aſmuch as if he himſelfe did ſpeake in his owne perſon: and yet all come not to Ieſus Chriſt. Ther are a great many that go back the more whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue heard the Goſpel: for then the deuill kindleth them in ſuch a rage, that they are more outragious the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer before, &amp; this commeth to paſſe, becauſe there is a twofolde hearing: the one is preaching: For the voice of a man will not enter into the hearts of his hearers. I ſpeake, but it behooueth that I heare my ſelfe beeing taught by the ſpirit of God: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the word which procedeth from my mouth,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:43"/> ſhould profite me no more then it doth all others, except it be giuen me from aboue, and not out of mine owne head. Therfore the voice of man is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſound that vaniſheth in the ayre, and notwithſtanding it is the power of God to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to all beleeuers (ſaith Saint Paule.) When then God ſpeaketh vnto vs, by the mouth of men, then he adioyneth the inwarde grace of his holy ſpirit, to the ende, that the doctrine be not vnprofitable, but that it may bring forth fruite. See then howe wee heare the heauenly father: that is to ſay: when hee ſpeaketh ſecretly vnto vs by his holy ſpirit: &amp; then we come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. Mark then, the ſumme of that we haue to learne: that is, when God declareth vnto vs his eternall election, &amp; that he hath giuen vs ſuch a teſtimonie, that wee cannot dout therof: when he hath ſhewed vs that this is our benefite &amp; ſaluation: and ſo that we take not too much libertie, to wrangle againſt him, and to enter into crooked &amp; ouerthwart diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that then the whole ſhall profite vs. For it is certaine, that this is the true reioycing of the faithfull, to be inſtructed concerning this election of God. Moreouer: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee the wicked to caſt foorth their cauels againſt God, &amp; their ſlaunders to peruert all, and to bringe this doctrine into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, let vs not think it ſtraunge: for it muſt needs bee that they declare them ſelues to be reprobates. I haue ſaid, that we muſt reſt our ſelues in the euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting councel of God, whereby hee hath choſen ſome, &amp; caſt off others. If now the reprobate come
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:7669:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> to fight againſt the trueth of God, it is no newe thing: For they are appointed to this, and it muſt needes be that they declare themſelues to bee ſuch as they are: and wee muſt call to minde that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Oſe the which is put in the ende of his Booke: <hi>The wayes of the Lorde are good &amp; right:</hi> alſo <hi>The righteous will walke in them, but the wicked ſhall fall therein.</hi> Now he addeth alſo: <hi>Who is wiſe that will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand this? And who is a prudent man that wil vnderſtand theſe thinges?</hi> The Prophet ſheweth that when wee ſpeake of the iudgements of God, it behoueth that we haue a ſpeciall wiſedome to receaue them: and ſhall this wiſdome be found in al our braines? that is farre off. So then it behoueth that we haue a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome giuen vs by the meere mercie of God.</p>
               <p>Nowe that which followeth is to ſhewe vs, that this is a rare and moſt excellent thinge, when men ſhall be apte to bee taught and modeſt, and that they ſhall yeelde to bee ledde by God, and ſhall ſuffer them ſelues to bee gouerned by his woorde, when they ſhall receaue full inſtruction, which ſhall bee vnto them a good foode for their ſoules: When this ſhall come to paſſe, it muſt bee acknowledged to bee a rare and ſingular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of God, and muſt aſſure vs that he hath bleſſed vs. And therefore it behooueth that we be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and prepared againſt all offences, If wee ſee that the wicked ſhall come to puſhe with their Hornes againſt GOD, and to barke and ſhewe their teeth as Maſtiues, when they cannot byte, then let vs practiſe this doctrine of the Prophet,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:44"/> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith that the wayes of God are righteous, &amp; good, yea and the righteous ſhall walk in them. We ſhall alwayes finde this, ſo that we haue not a malicious and frowarde ſpirit, that may turne vs from God: but let vs be quiet, and let vs aſke no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that our Lord ſhew vs the path that we ought to followe: when we ſhall be ſuch, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that we ſhall alwayes finde euen grounde, &amp; there ſhall be no queſtion, that wee ſhoulde walke and take our pleaſure. Beholde, I ſay, the ioy wee ſhall haue, when wee ſhall walke in the Lordes wayes: but contrariwiſe it is ſaid, that the wicked ſhall fall. And where? ſhal it be in hell? Shall it bee in the Deuils way? It is ſaid that it ſhall bee in the very wayes of God, that all that ſhall bee ſet forth vnto them of the iudgements of God, of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counſaile, of his prouidence, &amp; of his fatherly loue, he beareth to his children: in all theſe (ſaith he) the wicked ſhall fall. So let vs be in ſuch wiſe eſtabliſhed, that all the ruines and falles which we ſhall ſee before our eyes, hynder vs not from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching alwayes forwards in that good way which our Lord doth ſet before vs. But it behoueth vs oftentimes to remember that which is heere han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled by Moyſes? And that is, he ſayth expreſſely,
<q>That the one ſhalbe ſtronger then the other, and the elder ſhall ſerue the younger.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſpeaking of the ſtronger, it is to ſhewe vs, that when Gods election is ſtedfaſt and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that we are vpholden by his holy ſpirite,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:7669:44"/> we muſt no longer feare: &amp; this is a very profitable poynt, yea neceſſary. For what is our condition? There needes not but one puffe of wind to beate vs down, &amp; there needes but a flye to dazel our eyes: and yet wee are heere layde open to ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, as nothing more. Beholde our enemyes which are in number infinite: and I ſpeake not of thoſe which we ſee with the eye, but of ſpirituall enemies: For the aire is full of deuils, which lye in wayte for vs, yea which are as roring Lyons, beſides their ſlights. Alas what ſhall wee be able to doe? It muſt needes be that we be in diſtreſſe &amp; vexation continually &amp; without ende, &amp; that we be as poore people ſtricke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thorow, if we knew not that our Lorde hath our ſaluation in his owne hand, and that hee will keepe it. S. Peter ſayth that it is well kept in hope, and that faith is as it were a capcaſe: but hee ſendeth vs to God: and our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte hath yet declared this more plaine vnto vs, when he ſaith, that all that was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him of his father, ſhall not periſh. And why ſo? The father who hath giuen you (ſayth he) vnto me, is ſtronger then all. So then, he ſayth that wee may reioyce in this, that God will haue pitie vpon vs vntill the end, and that he wil keepe vs: and although he ſuffer vs to ſtumble, yea ſo as we fall, yet we ſhall be recouered &amp; vpholden by his hand. And how is it that we can truſt in this? Without election it is impoſſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when wee knowe that the father hath committed vs into the keeping of his ſonne, we are certaine, that we ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:7669:45" rendition="simple:additions"/> bee maintained by him vnto the ende: For wee haue his promiſe whereby he hath bound himſelfe vno vs, to preſerue vs: &amp; farther he maketh it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the laſt day, vntill the reſurrection. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the beginning and end of our ſaluation is in him, ſee in whome we may reioyce our ſelues: That is, that in acknowledging our weakneſſes &amp; brickleneſſe, and that we are nothing, and that we want all things: yet we may ſay: the Lorde which hath called me vnto himſelfe, will finiſh his owne worke: as is ſaid in the 138. Pſalme. <hi>Lord thou wilte not leaue the worke of thine owne handes in the middeſt.</hi> So then we muſt holde faſt this doctrine, that the one ſhalbe more ſtrong: For our faith ſhall remaine victorious ouer all the world. And how? It beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs (I ſay) to haue our foundation vppon the election of God: that we may be ſo ſetled thereon, that wee knowe that our Lorde beeing our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will not ſuffer that we periſhe, ſeeing wee are his children. Now Moyſes addeth by and by that the elder ſhall ſerue the younger. In this wee haue yet a more ample confirmation of that which I touched euen nowe, that is, that we muſt be ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of our ſaluation, although that we be weake, &amp; that the world deſpiſe vs, and we haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhew of ſtrength. And why ſo? God would that we ſhould for a time be the leſſer: that is to ſay, that we ſhould be little and deſpiſed to the end, that his glory might be the more knowen &amp; eſteemed. For if we had greatneſſe and glory in our ſelues, &amp; dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, it is certaine that theſe ſhould be as vailes, to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:7669:45"/> ſhadowe the meere and free bountie of God: but when we are weake in our ſelues, ſee wherein it is knowen, that it is hee which doeth all: &amp; it muſte needes be that his hand be in ſuch ſort aduaunced, that we come not to mingle our ſelues therin, and that we throw not forth our cloudes to hinder that the praiſe of our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be wholly attributed to him. Marke then that we haue heere to learne, that is on the one ſide, although that we be weake, that we ceaſe not to goe freely forward, knowing that our ſtrength conſiſteth in God: and when he doth not fully ſhewe it, it is to the end that our weaknes ſhould be an occaſion to humble vs. See this for one principall point. And in very deede we ſhould be colde, yea and quite negligent in calling vppon him, if we knewe not our neceſſitie: but when we ſee that we can do nothing, then we muſt haue our refuge to him, who can ſupply all our wantes: and then wee ſhall render vnto him the ſacrifice of praiſe which is due vnto him, after that wee haue byn heard of him. In the meane time alſo we haue to note that God doth not at the firſt daſh, ſhew to the viewe of the eye our ſaluation: but it muſt bee hid in appeara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and that for a time we be as caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awayes, and that the wicked treade vs vnder their feete, &amp; that they be in degree without compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, more high then we: Notwithſtanding let it ſuffice vs, that we are as a precious treaſure before God. Behold alſo why our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Feare not my little flock, but reioyce, and be not as a ſcattered and diſcomforted flocke.</hi> And why ſo? Becauſe the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther delighteth in thee</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:46"/>
               <p>Mark then from whence we muſt haue all our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing: marke of whome we muſt bee armed, to haue victory, and to tryumph againſt all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When we ſee in theſe dayes the enemyes of the Goſpel, and the Deuils ſupporters, to make their bragges, and make no account of others in compariſon of them ſelues, and when in the meane time they deſpiſe vs: and not only that, but farther account vs as moſt deſperate creatures, as though we were vnworthy (as men ſay) to be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of Dogges. When therefore wee ſhall ſee this at this day, yea, that the greateſt number ſhal be as poore ſtaruelings, and that they ſhal haue no bread to eate, that they ſhall not haue their eaſe nor their commoditie: Let vs remember that, that is heere ſpoken, that the greater ſhall ſerue the leſſer. Now this ſeruice came not to paſſe at the firſt daſhe. For we ſhal ſee afterwards that Iacob came to crowch before his brother, and called him his Lorde: hee trembled as a poore Lamb before him, and then gaue him all his goods as a pray. And where was this ſubiection of Eſau? where was the ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Iacob, when hee ſubmitted him ſelfe in ſuch ſort? It ſeemeth that he giues vp all: but hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God would not acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſh this at the firſte day. Marke then why he did beare his pouertie ſo patiently: becauſe God would (as if a man might ſay) that he ſhould creepe vppon the earth, and yet this ſhall not hinder, but that hee ſhould alwayes attayne to that ſaluation, wherunto he was called. And why ſo? For God dependeth not vppon all
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7669:46"/> all theſe earthly things. And which is more (as I haue already ſayd) he will that we begin heere, to humble our ſelues before him: following that which I alleadged ere while from the mouth of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, that ſo we knowe that our Heauenly Father bee well pleaſed with vs, wee paſſe not for the reſte, or rather that wee bee not ſo ſhaken that this doe depraue vs and bring vs out of taſt, and ſo hinder vs from doing good: but that wee doubte not that amiddeſt all the troubles and greefes that may happen vnto vs, we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes wherein to reioyce. For who ſhall ſeperate vs from the loue that God hath borne vs in Chriſt our Lorde? ſeeing that God hath choſen vs in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that he hath called vs to the faith of his Goſpel, &amp; hath imprinted in our harts the teſtimonie of his fatherly loue, we wil alwaies defie our enemyes, although we be poore and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yea though we be nothing in the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of men: yet we ſhall not ceaſe to be groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vppon this promiſe: <hi>That the greater ſhall ſerue the leſſe and younger.</hi> And ſeeing it is ſo, let vs not deſire to bee great after the worlde: for although that we be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temptible &amp; deſpiſed, yet this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth vs not from beeing the heires of the world: although we neither haue landes nor poſſeſſions, yet doe all things belong vnto vs, &amp; contrariwiſe the wicked haue an horrible and heauie accounte to make, for that they in ſuch ſorte deuoure Gods benefites, and reioyce ſo much concerning thoſe riches which he hath giuen them, and yet glorifie
<pb facs="tcp:7669:47"/> not God in them. But they muſt pay full dearely for them: and as for vs, although we bee ſtripped of all riches, that we be in opprobrie &amp; reproch: to be ſhort, that there is nothing but pouertie in vs, yet ſeeing we know that hee hath his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſtretched out to vpholde vs, we may boaſt our ſelues againſt all our enemies. And in the meane time let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which is ſaide in Eſay, that we are as a precious crowne in the hand of the Lord, and as the ring of his finger, and as his ſeale, and that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Egypt nor Aſſyria: that is to ſay, the greateſt Monarchies of the world, are ſo highly eſteemed of him as we are: not for any value that is in vs (as I haue ſaid alredy:) but becauſe it hath pleaſed him to choſe vs, &amp; to reſerue vs in the number of thoſe whome he will haue to him ſelfe: and wee knowe this, foraſmuch as we ſee through faith and hope, that he hath drawen vs from thoſe gulfes, in which we were, to the end he might bring vs to an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting inheritance.</p>
               <p>Now let vs fall downe before the face of our good God, in acknowledging our offences, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, that he will in ſuch ſorte make vs to feele them, that it may be to ſpoile vs of all wicked luſts and rebellions, and that wee may be ſo renewed, that we may ratifie our vocation in lyuing holyly &amp; confirming our ſelues wholly to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that he wil ſo ſupporte vs in our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that he ſuffer vs not howſoeuer wee bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with ſo many enemyes, that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer faile: but that he wil ſupply all our weakeneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:7669:47"/> to the ende that his election may declare his power euen to the end, &amp; that we may in ſuch ſort feele the frute thereof, that we may haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to glorifie him, both in life and death.</p>
               <p>And ſo let vs all ſay, ô Almightie God &amp; heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, wee acknowledge and confeſſe in our ſelues as the truth is, that we are not worthy, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Ecauſe the election of GOD is ſecret in it ſelfe, it is neceſſary that it ſhewe it ſelfe with the time, as God cauſed his workes to come to perfection: For it ſufficeth not that God haue once choſen vs, and that he haue marked vs, but he muſt alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinewe
<pb facs="tcp:7669:48"/> this to the ende, and that he declare that his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not in vain, but that he hath his ſtrength and power to conduct vs to ſaluation. Now hee doth this after diuerſe ſortes: For God is not bound to keepe alwayes one courſe: he hath his meanes, ſuch as it pleaſeth him to appoynt. Sometime he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his election very quickly: ſometime he defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth it for a long ſpace: and they that thinke, that there is a certaine ſeede, in all thoſe whome God hath elected, ſo as men may diſcerne them from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they are enclyned to good, and haue ſome affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſerue God: they fouly ouerſhoote themſelues, and are alſo conuinced by experience.</p>
               <p>Iohn Baptiſt was ſanctified from the wombe of his mother: but it is farre otherwiſe in many others. For God ſuffereth his electe ſometimes to be as ſcattered ſheepe, and they ſeeme as though they were altogether loſt: and this is to the ende to giue the greater glory to his grace. As wee ſee now ſome ſigne in Iacob, that God had choſen him, and reiected his brother Eſau. For Iacob held the heele of his brother, as if he had fought againſt him. And this came not to paſſe by chaunce, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it doone by nature: but God ſhewed as it were with the finger, that Eſau was the firſte borne, and yet was neuertheleſſe put back: and Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, who was the inferiour in his birth, ſhould yet in time be preferred. Mark then what we haue to learne vpon this place: that is, that God will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue that which he hath pronounced as we ſaw yeſterday: <hi>That the greater ſhall ſerue the leſſer:</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7669:48"/> And this hath already beene ſhewed in the birth of twoo infantes. But of this example we haue to gather in generall, that thoſe whome God hath choſen, he hath preuented: &amp; by this meanes doth ratifie his counſell and decree, when his executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appeareth. And ſo, though we can not enter ſo farre, to knowe who they are that were elected before the foundation of the world: notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our election ſhalbe teſtified vnto vs, ſo farre foorth as ſhall be neceſſary: For if God (as a man woulde ſay) doe keepe the protocoll or originall draught thereof with him ſelfe, it followeth not but that hee doth giue vs ſuch teſtimonie thereof, that we may be aſſured that he both is and will be a father vnto vs to the end: &amp; that we ſhould call vpon him in this affiance. For it is not ſaide heere albeit there were a vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the holy ſcripture ſpeaketh) that is to ſay, that he had declared vnto Iacob that he had elected him. This wil com with the time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it is ſaid ſimply that God had ſhewed it as it were to the eye, that the anſwere which he had giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Rebecca was not in vain. Why ſo? the effect appeared in this, that Iacob helde the heele of his brother. But heere by the way God would ſhewe by this figure, that his electe come not to their ende without many combates. It is true that Iacob knewe not what this ment, and his age alſo did not ſuffer it: but this notwithſtanding muſte ſerue to teach vs, and is ſet foorth as it were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare vnto vs, that God will haue vs to fight, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee hath taken vs into his cuſtodie, yea,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:49"/> though wee bee in his protection and conducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hee will haue vs to hope for ſaluation from him, and that that which hee hath begun ſhall bee accomplyſhed.</p>
               <p>Although then that all this be true, yet will he not haue vs ſluggiſh: but hee will that euery one of vs ſtriue to the ende, that we may be led to that ende whervnto hee hath called vs. Marke then that which we haue to learne of this which Moyſes rehearſeth, that Iacob held the heele of his brother. Now he addeth:
<q>And the elder was called Eſau, and the other Iacob.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As touching the ſecond, it is as if a man ſhould call him <hi>Heeleholder,</hi> but of Eſau it is ſayde, that hee came from the wombe of his mother altogither rough and couered with heare, as if he had beene a man already. See alſo from whence he tooke his name.</p>
               <p>Wee ſee then the difference betwixte theſe two: that is, that a man would haue ſaide that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau, was to be farre aduaunced aboue his brother. For we ſee him thorowly faſhioned, he is big, and ſheweth great ſtrength: To be ſhort, he is not as a childe, but as a man. But of Iacob, there is no other thing, but the hand that helde him by the heele, and he was as a thing borne before his time: &amp; when they grewe, he continued euen ſo. For Eſau was a Hunter, a man of trauel: (as if a man would ſay) nothing but ſtrength. Of Iacob it is very true that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7669:49" rendition="simple:additions"/> the name which Moyſes vſeth, is taken in good parte and ſignifieth ſounde or perfect: Howbeit it was a ſimplicitie which was oppoſed againſt all that which was more apparaunt in Eſau: and in very deede Moyſes addeth, that he kept the houſe, that hee was as it were a Cooke alwayes ſitting in the Aſhes. Marke then what wee haue to conſider in Eſau and Iacob.</p>
               <p>Nowe this is an inſtruction to confirme that wee haue intreated off before: That is to ſay, that GOD hath not choſen men according to the outwarde ſhewe they may haue: but contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that which is accounted moſte excellent, he forſaketh and deſpiſeth: And that which is as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected of men, that doth he aduaunce. Wee ſee it alwayes: but yet ther is no doubte, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſte ment to ſette foorth this in the perſon of our father Iacob, to the ende that we ſhoulde learne to beate downe all fooliſh preſumption, and ſhoulde not ſearch in our ſelues, why GOD doth chooſe vs, why alſo he continueth his grace towardes vs: but that wee ſhoulde knowe that he would be gloryfied in our littleneſſe: and wee ſhall haue well profited, when this doctrine ſhall be imprinted in our heartes.</p>
               <p>For there is nothing that more turneth vs a way from God, then when wee deſire to haue ſome vertue woorthy of prayſe: but we muſt be vtterly ſpoyled thereof, or elſe we ſhal be ſo puffed vp, that the grace of GOD can not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs: So muche the more then it behoueth vs to
<pb facs="tcp:7669:50"/> lay good hold vpon this which is ſo neceſſary for vs: that is to ſay, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God choſeth vs, that this is not (as men ſay) for our faire eyes. And finally, if we bee deſpiſed of the worlde, let vs not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee diſcouraged: as wee haue ſhewed, that it ought thorowely to content vs that we be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, although the worlde diſdaine vs: For we ſee what was in Iacob: one ſtil ſitting in the houſe, as if a man wold ſay, a Doe nothing, or Idle body. It is true that he was entire, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was it? Whence was this ſimplicitie taken? did hee any notable thing? had he any reputation? he had nothing at all. But ſee Eſau, who was as it were aboue the cloudes euen from his birth, hee was a man allready, he had ſtrength in him ſelfe: &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when he grew he had great induſtrie, ſo that it ſeemed that he was to workwonders. Very wel, in this we are taught that all comes of God. For if wee ſhoulde ſeeke the cauſe of election in men, it is certaine that euery one would giue his voyce to Eſau without doubt. But notwithſtanding all this, God preferreth Iacob: and why ſo? This is quite contrary to that we imagine. So then wee haue to marke, that God hath in ſuch ſorte diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his grace, that he would haue men to knowe, that it was his onely goodneſſe that mooued him to loue Iacob. Nowe this doctrine is well woorthy to bee meditated vppon, all the dayes of our life: and this is (as I haue ſayde) too beate downe all the ouerweening that men haue in them ſelues, to the ende that there bee nothing
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7669:50"/> but the meere mercie of God that may ſhine in this thing: &amp; in the meane time let vs knowe that the Church was alwayes ſmall in her beginnings, yea, and that God, hath after ſuch ſorte aduaunced it, that on mens partes theire infirmitie muſte ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and that they muſt alwayes acknowledge it, to the ende men ſubmit them ſelues to ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And againe, howſoeuer it be, let vs knowe, that God wil neuer forſake his owne woork, but will bring it to his right perfection, although it be not knowen of men at the firſt daſhe: For neither ought it to be ſo, neither is it profitable. Againe, if God giue any ſigne that hee haue choſen vs vnto him ſelf, and that this bee ſhewed euen from our infancie, we haue ſo much the more, wherefore to glorifie God: For the more his grace is enlarged, the more praiſe it deſerueth: but if we remaine for a time as reiected, and that God maketh no ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce of hauing any regarde vnto vs: but rather that wee be as it were forgotten, and in the ende hee calleth vs back againe, when wee haue for a longe time gone aſtray: heerein alſo ſhall we haue a double occaſion to prayſe him. To bee ſhorte, howſoeuer he worke in vs, it behooueth that our mouth bee alwayes open to acknowledge his goodneſſe and mercie. There bee ſome which from their childehood will declare that GOD hath kept them, as if hee had helde them by the hand, and ſhould bring them foorth to ſay: Theſe are mine, and in deede they haue a good inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their infancie, and further it ſhall profite
<pb facs="tcp:7669:51"/> in them, in ſuch ſorte as men ſhall ſay: Beholde a ſeede of God.</p>
               <p>Now theſe (as I haue ſaid) are deepely bound to acknowledge that God had giuen them this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For what haue they more then others? wee are altogither corrupted in Adam. So then, when God leadeth them as it were by a continuall thred from their birth, euen vntil their olde age, ſo much the more are they bound vnto him. But there are others, who are as poore and miſerable creatures: whome men would ſay that God had wholly caſt from him, and the one ſort are lewde and diſſolute in their youth, the other ſort miſerable Idolaters: and whatſoeuer deuotion they haue, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is alwayes to eſtraunge them ſomuch the more from God, and to prouoke his wrath, yea ſometimes they are enemyes to all trueth: as wee may ſee in the example of S. Paule, who was as an outragious beaſte ſhedding innocent bloode, and ſtriuing for nothing more as a rauening Wolfe, then to ſcatter all the Churches. Againe, ſee the Corinthians, who were whore maiſters, &amp; giuen to all kinde of villanies, as Saint Paule declareth: And aſmuch is ſaide of the Romaines. <hi>Yee were</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>in times paſt, both whoremongers and proude per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp; giuen to all oppresſion &amp; deceit, yeelding al your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to euill, &amp; to the ſeruice of ſinne.</hi> And a little after he ſayth to the Epheſians: <hi>Yee were in times paſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, without any hope of life, ye were altogither darkenes, ye were in euerlasting death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now when our Lorde, to the ende to humble vs, ſhall ſuffer vs for a time to bee ſo ſcattered, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:7669:51"/> then ſhall ſuddainly call vs to himſelfe: let vs acknowledge and ſay alas wee ought not onely to magnifie GOD for that hee hath choſen vs, as wee ſee the fruite thereof: but alſo becauſe he hath drawen vs from this gulfe, wherin we were. And ſo much the more muſt we ſtriue and redeeme the time paſt, as S<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paule ſpeaketh thereof,<note place="margin">Ephe. <hi>5.</hi>8.</note> in that we haue alleadged: <hi>Yee were ſometimes darkeneſſe, but nowe you are light in the Lorde</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>and therefore walke as Children of light.</hi> And let vs often remember that which our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaith. <hi>There are many ſheepe that are not of this folde.</hi> For he ſpake of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who were ſhut out from all hope of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He calleth them ſheepe, not in reſpect of them ſelues: For they were ſauage beaſtes: but in reſpect of Gods election: although they were a ſcattered people, yet he ſayth, that he would gather them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. Therefore when it pleaſeth God to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe vs from diſſipation wherin we haue beene, let vs learne to giue eare to the voice of this great Paſtor: not onely by giuing ſome outwarde ſigne that we doe allow it: but that it be to followe him and obay him in all thinges.</p>
               <p>Marke then what it is, that wee haue to learne out of this place. And farther let vs not bee aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when the Lord ſhall not giue vnto his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and to his whole Church, ſuch a goodly ſhewe amongſt men, to the ende to bee had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation: Let vs not bee aſhamed of our baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that he be gloryfied. As nowe it ſeemeth that the Church muſte bee troden vnder feete:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:52"/> and wee ſee alſo howe prophane people and the Children of this worlde, make no reckoning of thoſe whome God hath gathered to him ſelfe.</p>
               <p>Now let vs beare this patiently, after the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our father Iacob: &amp; let it not trouble vs, if the worlde (in a manner) doe ſpyt in our face, ſo that we be approued of GOD. Marke then, howe euery one of vs haue to practiſe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in him ſelfe, and alſo in the whole body of the Church.</p>
               <p>And againe, although wee bee not eſtemed of the worlde, and that fewe doe allowe vs and clap their handes at vs, yet God woorketh in ſuche ſorte, that that which is moſt contemptible in the worlde, and in the outwarde ſhewe thereof, is more eſteemed before, God then that which hath great ſhew &amp; ſetting out before men. And heerein is that acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plyſhed, which is ſpoken in S. Luke. That that which is high and excellent heere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, is not therefore eſteemed of God, but much rather is ſometime an abhomination vnto him: as it is certaine that the vertues of Eſau ſhall alwayes be prayſed, if men were Iudges: but yet Iacobs ſimplicitie before God and his Angels, is in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtimation.</p>
               <p>Let vs therefore march on as our Lorde Ieſus hath commaunded vs: and let it not greeue vs, though there appeare not in vs at the firſt daſhe, theſe giftes which God hath put in vs. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. There are many who are nothing worth in reſpect of God, yet they haue a goodly ſhew, &amp;
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:7669:52"/> alſo there be occaſion therof. Men ſhall find great perſonages, of great eſtate and qualitie, who ſhall haue greate valure, and be in great authoritie: ſhall be in honor and dignitie: and farther there ſhalbe no extreme couetouſnes in them: to be ſhort, there ſhall appeare ſuch an honeſtie in them, that you would thinke them Angels, and all men will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll them euery where: and in the meane time there ſhall bee poore handycraftes men, huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, &amp; poore idiotes, who haue no opportunitie to ſhew themſelues: For they ſhalbe buſied in their ſhop &amp; ſmal houſholde: they muſt trauel to nuriſh their poore children. A man ſhall heare no great fame of them, they are not eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to ſhew forth any great wiſedome: and when a man ſhall heare them ſpeake, hee ſhall ſee nothing but folly, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the common opinion: and yet GOD hath elected and choſen them. Hee alloweth that which ſeemeth to bee of no value: For albeit it ſeeme that theſe are baſe thinges, that a man ſew or doe ſome other thing, and take paine, yet this is a ſeruice that GOD more eſteemeth off, than we can imagine.</p>
               <p>So then, when we knowe that we are nothing in outwarde ſhewe, let vs not think our ſtate and condition to be the woorſe for it (and as I haue ſayde already) let vs not bee aſhamed of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie: and in the meane time, let vs lift vp our eyes on high, &amp; though we lye in the aſſhes, let vs knowe that aſmuch happened to our father Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob before, who was a figure of all the electe of
<pb facs="tcp:7669:53"/> God and of his children. Now it followeth.</p>
               <q>That Iacob was loued of his mother, and Eſau of his father.</q>
               <p>And this ſerueth well to ſhewe that there was no ſuche perfection in Iſaack, as there ought to haue beene: For hee was not ignoraunt of that which had beene ſpoken: <hi>That the greater ſhould ſerue the leſſer:</hi> He knewe ful well, that ſo was the will of God, that Eſau the elder ſhoulde yeelde bothe the place and degree of honour vnto his brother: and yet he loued Eſau: it ſeemeth heerein that he would reſiſt the counſell of GOD. And what meanes hee heerein? When hee will caſt his whole loue towardes Eſau: Yet God will reigne in the ende and his election muſte ſtande faſt, yea though all the worlde ſhoulde ſtriue againſt it. Loe Iſaack, who is very blockiſhe: yet there is more: for it ſeemeth that hee is led by a brutiſh affection. For why did hee loue Eſau? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that hee brought him Veniſon. Hee loued him therefore for his toothes ſake. Beholde an ancient man: and who by reaſon of his age ought to haue beene ſtayed and ſetled: hee ſhoulde no more haue beene led of his fooliſh and inconſtant affections, that for his tothes ſake &amp; licoriſhnes, he ſhould haue forgotten that which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, yea, by an vnchaungeable decree: that Iacob muſt gouerne, and that hee ſhould be heyre of the promiſe: and yet that Iſaack maketh no rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:7669:53"/> of it. But heere wee ſee that the Iewes are too to blinde, vaunting them ſelues in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as though the dignitie which they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had, came from the holyneſſe and vertues of men. For it is certaine that Iſaack, aſmuch as in him lay, ouerthrew the election of God: not that he had a will ſo to doe. For if a man ſhould haue aſked him, how now? Wilt thou reſiſt God? wilt thou let, that hee ſhall not put in execution, that which he hath pronounced? wilte thou alter that which hee hath pronounced by his mouth? Hee would haue ſaid. No: and his intent was not ſuch. But howſoeuer it be, he is driuen and drawen that way.</p>
               <p>So then wee may not ſay, that Iſaack wente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to helpe the election, of God nor ſet it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but contrariwiſe he hindred it. Now by this we ſee, that all mouthes muſt be ſhut, and that men pretend not too haue had any thinge in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to ſay that God ſhould confirme vnto them the bliſsings which hee had already giuen them. To be ſhort, we ſee heereby, that lyke as the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, is free &amp; vndeſerued in his firſte begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning &amp; foundation, and in full force, ſo alſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth that God ſhew vnto the ende, that there is nothing but his only mercy and that all that is ſaid on mans behalfe, doe ceaſe &amp; be aboliſhed, &amp; that this is not, either of the willer or of the runner (as S. Paule ſaith) Rom. 9. Marke then what wee haue to learne. Now in the meane time we ſee alſo the ſtedfaſtnes which is in this counſell of God,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:54"/> whereby hee choſeth thoſe, whome he thinketh good. So we haue to reſolue our ſelues, although the whole world ſhould labour to ouerthrow our ſaluation, that yet it wil remaine ſure, ſo that wee haue our refuge alwayes to that which hath byn ſhewed vs before: that is to ſay, That our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt hath taken into his keeping all that the father hath giuen him, as beeing his owne: &amp; that nothing therof ſhall periſhe, foraſmuch as God is ſtronger then men: for it is thither that hee doth leade vs: <hi>The father who hath giuen you vnto me, is ſtronger then all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs learne to ſtay our ſelues wholly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the inuincible power of God, when there is any queſtion of being aſſured that in calling vpon him we ſhalbe heard, &amp; that we dout not but that as he hath brought vs into a good way, ſo he wil giue vs perſeuerance: and although that wee bee weake and frayle, yet hee will not ſuffer vs to fall: but wee ſhall alwayes bee ledde in ſuch ſorte, that hee will more and more encreaſe his power in vs. Wee muſte therefore come euen thus farre, namely that Iacob had not onely thoſe his enemyes whiche hadde no feare of GOD, and were irreligious, but euen his owne father I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack: yea who was then as chiefe in the Church: God had put him in truſt as it were with his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenaunt, to the end that he ſhould be the treaſorer thereof, and deſpenſe it: and yet neuertheleſſe hee (as it ſhould ſeeme) was an enemie to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Iacob. Wherefore if we ſee many contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:7669:54"/> and that it ſeemeth our ſaluation muſt bee ouerthrowne by many meanes, and that wee ſee no iſſue, let vs then knowe that God wil be victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in the ende: and whatſoeuer weakeneſſe bee founde in vs, neuertheleſſe he wil not ceaſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede, and although there be reſiſtance and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction heere beneath, yet neuertheleſſe hee will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome all, and bring it wel aboute. But by the way, we are heere admoniſhed by the example of Iſaack, to holde our ſelues vnder the bridle. For if this happened vnto ſuch a man as Iſaack was, ſo excellent and of an Angelicall holyneſſe, that hee reſiſted God, what ſhall become of vs in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? It is certaine, that we ſhall euery day be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken an hundred times, with ſome vaine fantaſie, that we ſhall ruſh againſt God, although wee haue no ſuch purpoſe. Wee haue great neede therefore to diſtruſt our owne iudgement, and to call vpon God, to the end that he will gouerne vs by his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirit: otherwiſe (as I haue ſaid) we are as wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched ſtrayes, and we ſhall goe hither and thither at all aduentures. And when we weene to be very wiſe, there will be nothing but folly in vs, yea re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, although it bee not with our willes and knowledge. Marke this then for one leſſon, But we muſt marke heere the cauſe which is heere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Moyſes, when hee ſayth that Iſaack loued Eſau: And wherfore did he loue him? Becauſe that Veniſon was his meate. Therfore let vs take heede that we be not led by our carnall and earthly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, if we will keepe our array towards God. It
<pb facs="tcp:7669:55"/> is true, that to eate and drinke are not condemned. For God hath placed vs in this world vnder that condition that we ſhould enioy his creatures: and ſeeing he hath ordained vs to eate and to drinke, it is certaine that we offend him not: when we deſire to haue for our neceſſities, &amp; ſearch out alſo the vſe of thoſe benefites, which he hath prepared for vs. For it is not ſaid without cauſe, that we muſt do al things in his name, yea both in eating &amp; drinking: but in that we be corrupted, it cannot bee but there wil be alwaies exceſſe in our appetites, &amp; this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe maketh vs to forget our duties towards God: ſo as we are are altogither drawen away on euery ſide: &amp; when we thinke to doe our duties we are far therefro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But Iſaack ought alwaies to haue had this before his eyes, yea &amp; he ought to haue had it engrauen in his heart, this voice ſhould haue ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his eares, to wit, that the greater ſhuld ſerue the leſſe: he ought without ende, and without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, thus to haue thought: wel, foraſmuch as God wil haue his election to remaine in Iacob, it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that I agree vnto it. But in the meane time his meate turneth him, &amp; draweth him quit contrary. Let vs therfore bee wel aduiſed (as I haue already ſayde) on our partes, to repreſſe our deſires, yea though they be naturall, &amp; of them ſelues not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull. But to the end that there be no exceſſe nor intemperance: Let vs be aduiſed (I ſay) to check and to tame the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in ſuch ſorte that they neuer turne vs away, or hinder vs from ordering our ſelues according to the will of God. Marke therefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:7669:55"/> briefely what we haue to learne heere.</p>
               <p>But heere alſo wee ſee that Rebecca had an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction better guyded then her huſband. It is very true that alwayes men ſhall ſee (or for the moſte parte) that if the Father loue one of his Children, the moother will ſette her loue quite contrary: A man may ſee theſe contentions in moſte houſes. Alſo it may bee that Rebecca had conceiued ſome kinde of ielouſie: foraſmuch as ſhe ſawe Eſau pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: &amp; therefore ſhe loued Iacob the better, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as hee was not ſo acceptable to his father, nor had no ſuch fauour: but foraſmuch (as we ſhal ſee hereafter) that ſhe had regard vnto Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that ſhe alwayes held that which had byn ſaid, that Iacob muſt be preferred: we haue here to iudge that ſhe was not paſſionate and affected, as women that would lightly ſet themſelues againſt their huſbands, when they ſee that ſome of their children, ſhall not bee ſo much eſteemed, they will the more ſet their affections vpon them. But wee cannot iudge ſo of Rebecca: and why ſo? Becauſe we ſee (as I haue already ſaid) that ſhe alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred her ſelf to God, &amp; ment to obay that which he had pronounced. She would vndoubtedly that both the children might haue beene reſerued in the Church: but ſeeing ſhee ſawe the one ſhut out, and that there was none but the leſſer and inferiour that God allowed off, ſhe yeelded thereto. Nowe heere we ſee that our Lorde ſometimes will ſuffer thoſe, which haue the more vertues and greater giftes of the holy Ghoſte, yet neuertheleſſe to fall:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:56"/> and that they who were not yet ſo aduaunced as they ſhould outgoe them, I meane in ſome reſpect. For if wee make compariſon of Iſaack with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beca, it is certaine that hee hauing beene brought vp in the houſe of his father, &amp; hauing receiued ſo great inſtruction in his youth, had generally a greater faith then Rebecca. But beholde a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar action, wherin he fayleth, and wherin his vice ſheweth it ſelf. And yet Rebecca who lately craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of a den of idolatrie: as we knowe that in her fathers houſe, there was nothing but ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the countrie was altogither corrupted: this poore woman, although ſhe knew not God in her youth: yet notwithſtanding ſhe was ſo wel taught and inſtructed of the holy Ghoſte, that ſhe out-went her huſband. Nowe for this cauſe, they too whom God hath reached out the hande betimes, and whom he hath lifted vp, to be as mirrors vnto others: let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> learne alwayes to walke with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter carefulneſſe. And why ſo? For there needeth but one wrye ſtep to make them to fall ſo groſely, that euery one wil be aſhamed of them.</p>
               <p>And therefore let vs learne, that allbeit our Lord haue generally framed and faſhioned vs by his holy ſpirit in ſuch ſorte, that euery one hath vs in admiration, that yet in particular caſes, we may offende. Therefore let vs alwayes ſtand vpon our watch. Moreouer, they which are the moſte excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhall come to faile in ſome poynt, let them not make a buckler of this, that they haue done ſo many good deedes, and worthy of praiſe:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:7669:56"/> let them not alleadge their valiant deedes (as they ſay) but let them acknowledge them ſelues for ſuch as they be, and ſay: Wel, I perceiue that God would haue me to acknowledge that I am a weak man: and farther that I ſhould acknowledge in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that it is not in men to vphold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: for there needeth but one faulte alone to cauſe vs to be cut off fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the church. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God hath caſt vs of, what ſhal become of vs? So let vs learne al theſe thinges in the perſon of our father Iſaack, when we ſee that he was ſo blinded, and that he neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that he was as a rebel to God, in eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that, which God had reiected, and deſpiſing his younger ſonne: too whome notwithſtanding God had giuen this teſtimony: That he muſt rule in his houſe. Now in the meane tyme, although that Rebecca had bin wel guided in her affection, and that ſhee had ſought to obay God: yet it could not be but there muſt be ſome quarel betwene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as oftentimes it falleth out. And this is that which Moyſes ſaith. <hi>That Iſaack loued Eſau, and Rebecca loued Iacob:</hi> and when hee ſpeaketh ſo, it is as if hee woulde ſhewe that there was ſome ſtrife in the houſe, and that they coulde not agree togither, to ſay, that the huſba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d &amp; the wife ſhuld loue their children alike, as by nature they ought to haue bin enclyned thereto: or rather that they knewe that the wil of God was that they ſhoulde haue loued the yonger. Now we are warned in this behalfe, that albeit our affections be wel grounded &amp; tend to a good ende, that notwithſtanding there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

<pb facs="tcp:7669:57"/> alwayes croſſings which are blame woorthy. As for example. I ſeeke to followe God, and fully to conforme my ſelfe vnto his will: but there are reſiſtings, &amp; it muſt needes be that I muſt incurre diſpleaſure of the one, and purchaſe an enemie of the other, if I diſcharge my dutie. Likewiſe it is true, that the beginning ſhalbe good, when I ſhall deſire too doe well, and that I ſhall onely looke vnto God: but eueranon it wil befall vnto vs, that in our good zeale we ſhall be too exceſſiue, &amp; that we ſhal haue carnal paſſions in vs: To be ſhort: they which ſhalbe the beſt guyded, and who haue grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt perfection, it is very certaine that they ſhal yet paſſe meaſure in this place, and that they ſhal ſhew themſelues men: and ſo much the more ought we to ſuſpect our paſſions, and albeit wee ſee that the end be not good, yet we ſhall not ceaſe to fall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Againe, we alſo haue a good warning to leaue all contradictions: For it is not without cauſe that the ſcripture exhorteth vs ſo ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto this vnion, to be of one minde, and of one mouth. And why ſo? For when we agree in ſuch ſorte, eche one ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vp his neighbour, &amp; helpeth to bring him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. But contrariwiſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are quarrelling in contention and ſtrife, not onely one letteth and hindreth another (as it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſaid there needs but one reſtife Horſe to hinder the whole teame:) but yet ther is a worſe matter: to wit, that when wee ſtriue for the ſeruice of GOD, wee ceaſe not to forgette our ſelues in ſome reſpects, and many things eſcape vs, the which we woulde not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:7669:57"/> let ſlip, if we were out of ſtrife &amp; contention. This therfore is the matter we haue to learne. And theſe examples are dayly ſeen amongſt vs in the church. For the beſt ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of God &amp; they that are indew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t graces, yea &amp; who ſtriue for the trueth, yet neuertheles cannot alwaies ſo bridle themſelues, that they be not quarrelling, &amp; ſhowe themſelues men, and yet God alloweth their zeale and that which they doe. And why ſo? For bicauſe they haue a good beginning, and they haue a right end: but as I haue ſaid, there is alwaies infirmitie mingled therewith. Let vs therfore (ſay I) alwaies marke this, in this example of Iſaack and Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Againe, wee haue farther to note, that if ſome times we ſhall not agree ſo as we ought &amp; as were meete &amp; conuenient &amp; as we ought, to bend &amp; enforce our ſelues, that yet neuertheleſſe wee muſt make no deuorſe betwixt our ſelues, neither bee quite ſeparated aſunder. For although this was a notable vice, that Iſaack &amp; Rebecca were thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided in the loue, which they bare vnto their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yet they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued to ſerue God: &amp; Iſaack did neuer pretende to aboliſhe this oracle: that is to ſay, this ſame anſwere which God had giuen, that Iacob muſt gouerne.</p>
               <p>Now therfore we ſee heere how the huſband and the wife are at ſtrife, and that in ſuch a matter of importaunce, as wherevpon depended the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. For the queſtion is here of the eternal electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, the queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is of the whole church of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the head
<pb facs="tcp:7669:58"/> thereof: and beholde ſome crooked controuerſies betwixt Iſaack and his wife. Yet this meaneth not that Iſaack ment to ouerthrowe all: but he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode it not, and was confounded in him ſelfe. Likewiſe therefore, when through ignorance and errour, it ſhall ſometimes come to paſſe, that wee ſhalbe in trouble, and that the deuil ſhall thruſt in his foote, and that we ſhall not bee able to ſpeake with one and the ſame mouth: notwithſtanding, we muſt alwayes keepe the principall: that is, we muſt alwayes agree in this, that we holde God for our father: and that wee knowe that there is no true holy vnitie, but in Ieſus Chriſte: that wee holde, I ſay the principles of our faith: and if we cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend all things ſo diſtinctly as were to bee wiſhed, let the ignoraunt and weake bee humbled, and let them not be diſcouraged. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe let them that are more frowarde, beare with the weake, wayting when God wil turne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and take from them theſe opinions, wherin they are ſo troubled. This is that which Saint Paule ſayth vnto the Philippians: For hee ſhoweth how we ought to bee knit togither, and what the knot of our concorde and brotherhood is. Nowe hauing ſhewed, that he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth, that therfore there ſhuld not be diuerſities of opinions amongſt vs, &amp; that our ſpeaches likewiſe ſhould not be diuers. But yet (ſaith he) If you cannot come to ſuch pefection, &amp; that ſome go as it were halting, &amp; cannot ouertake others, which are not ſo quicke to comprehend all: <hi>Wayte</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>vntill GOD reueale it vnto you.</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:7669:58"/> Marke then the firſt thing that we haue to do, that is, to agree in the pure and ſimple trueth of God. But foraſmuch as it is not geuen to all at the firſte daſh, to haue certaine vnderſtanding of all points of religion: very wel, if there bee any ignorance, let them reach out their hand to them who are ſo beſotted, yea let them take heede that they bee not wilfull on their partes. For ſomtimes, yea moſte commonly a man ſhall ſee, that the blindeſt are boldeſt and raſheſt: and further there will be ſuch a wilfulneſſe, that a man can gain nothing of them. But S. Paule to remedie this miſchiefe, ſaith: <hi>Waite till God reueale it vnto you.</hi> This then is that wee haue to learne: but let vs alſo remember that which hee ſetteth downe: namely, that when we ſhal agree in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; that we reſpect nothing but his glorie, that alwayes we keepe our courſe, and if there bee ſome little ſtrife, that this ſeperate vs not one from another. For it ſhall bee enough when we haue this keye, though in many other thinges we bee not ſo reſolued as were neceſſary: yet if wee bee not quite withdrawen and turned from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, it is enough. Beſides when we ſhall tende to his glory, euery one ſhall knowe, yea the moſt forwarde, that they are yet farre of. What is the cauſe that thoſe which are learned and exerciſed in the ſcripture, doe diſdaine their brethren when they ſee them ignorant? It is foraſmuch as it ſeemeth vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting in them ſelues: but if wee knowe what it is to aſpire to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and
<pb facs="tcp:7669:59"/> to come to the glory of his reſurrection, wee will ſay alwayes with Saint Paule, that wee haue not attayned vnto it. When therefore euery one ſhall knowe, that there is yet ſomething lacking in him ſelf, it ſhall doe vs no hurt, &amp; we ſhall not think it ſtraunge to call our brethren, although it bee a farre off. Goe to let vs goe forward. It is true that there is great difference betwixte them that haue the gift of interpreting the Scriptures, and thoſe that are poore and ſimple idiotes: they wil know well that there is one God, who is their father by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, but yet they cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounde a place of holy Scripture: &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ceaſſe not to walke on in one &amp; the ſame path: &amp; thoſe which are the moſt forward, although they come ſooner to the goale, yet they muſt alwayes waite for the other. Mark then how we haue to doe, according as it is ſhewed vnto vs, &amp; how we may learne it, by the example which is heere contayned.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs fall downe before the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of our good God, in acknowledging of our faultes, praying him that hee will in ſuch ſorte make vs to feele them, that it may be to the end we may be diſpleaſed therewith, and that we alwayes may haue an eye to our condition which is ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, to the ende to haue our refuge to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: and that it wil pleaſe him to receiue vs to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and ſo to gouerne vs by his holy ſpirite that we may be rid of all earthly paſſions. And ſeeing there are ſo many vices hidden in vs, that wee
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:7669:59"/> may take the greater payne to examine our ſelues, to the ende alwayes to haue recourſe vnto him, who is able to cleanſe vs: and that wee maye ſo fight, againſt whatſoeuer thinge doeth hinder vs from dedicating our ſelues wholly to his ſeruice, that in the meane time we know, that it is farre of that our conflictes doe deſerue to bee approued of him, but ſo farre foorth as hee beareth with our weakeneſſe. And alſo that we may haue recourſe vnto his power, knowing the neede that wee haue to be ſuccoured of him: &amp; that by this meanes, we learne onely to reioyce in him, and not to doubte but that as he hath once reached vs the hande, he wil likewiſe continue more and more to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then vs, vntill that wee haue ouercome bothe the Deuill, and all the aſſaultes, that he can aſſayle vs withall.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſaid yeſterday that God appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth and ratifieth his election, when hee gouerneth his Children by his holy ſpirit, and that hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them to ſtriue vp to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly life, and giueth them an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to deſpiſe the world, and to looke vp more high. Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, that he diſcouereth what mans nature is, when he letteth looſe the bridle to thoſe that are reprobates, ſo that they become as it were brute beaſtes, loking to nothing but this brickle &amp; tranſitorie life. We haue the confirmation of this doctrine, in the hiſtory which Moyſes heere reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: For on the one ſide he ſetteth Eſau before vs, who returning out of the feeldes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hunting, was as a famiſhed wolf: he deſireth nothing but to eate, and moreouer is content to ſel his birthright with another and heere he renounceth his birthright, ſo that he may haue wherewith to fill his belly. Hee then eſteemeth the Pottage ſo highly, that his birthright was nothing vnto him in compariſon thereof. Now let vs marke (as it hath already byn touched before, and as we ſhal ſee more fully) that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:7669:60"/> this was not an earthly priuiledge, to wit, that he ſhould haue a double portion, and that he ſhoulde be aduaunced in his fathers houſe: but it was to be the chiefe of the Church of God, wayting till our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſhould appeare for the ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the worlde. Now although this was a thing of ſuch importance: yet Eſau preferreth his belly, and hee careth for nothing, ſo that hee may haue meate. On the other ſide, Iacob although he had made ready his dinner, or his ſupper (albeit it were his refection,) and that hee had an appetite to eate, yet, hee choſe rather to abſtaine and defraude him ſelfe, then to let ſlippe the occaſion of getting the birthright. Wee ſee then that Eſau was but as a beaſtly man, who fought nothing but to be fed and nouriſhed: yea and to bee well frankt. Iacob is a weake man, ſubiect to hunger and thirſt: yet hee bridleth himſelfe, and looketh vp higher then too this worlde, and forgoeth bodyly meate, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a ſpirituall benefite, which was of more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue then an hundred, yea then ten thouſand liues. Marke briefely what wee haue to learne of this hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is very true that a man might think at the firſt bluſh, that this was but a Childiſh toy. For what hurt was it in Eſau, after that he had laboured and taken great paine, yea for to bringe Veniſon vnto his father, if he were weary, if he weare an hungred &amp; ſhould demaund to eate? It ſeemeth not that this ſhould be imputed vnto him for a faulte. And againe on the other ſide, ſome man might
<pb facs="tcp:7669:61"/> ſay, what crueltie was there in Iacob, ſeeing his brother in ſuch want, not to ſuccour him, at the leaſt with halfe of his repaſt? For hee ſhoulde not haue tarryed his brothers complainte, and till hee had cryed for hunger, but rather ought frankly to haue offred him of that which he had prepared for him ſelfe. For if hee had ſeene but a ſtraunger too bee ſo needie, ſo weary, and ſo weake, hee muſte yet haue giuen him ſome refreſhinge and almes.</p>
               <p>But beholde his owne brother, for they were borne bothe in one belly: yet hee leaueth him in this caſe, and vouchſafeth not to giue him one ſpoonefull of his pottage. A man might ſay ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Iacob was too too vncurteous. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Why ſhoulde hee compell him to ſell his birthright? For hee put heere the knife as it were to his throte, and wee knowe that bargaines are alwayes of no force, when there ſhall be any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered: If men doe any thing by conſtraint, or if they promiſe any thing by compulſion raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are not bounde to keepe it. But ſee Eſau, who was an hungred, hee could doe no more, he was ſo farre paſt him ſelfe, that hee knoweth not what his birthright meaneth. So then, beſides the crueltie of Iacob, there was to groſe an ouerſight: and when he barganed, what otheſoeuer came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene, yet this ought not in any caſe to holde, by any right or reaſon. Well, notwithſtanding all this, this is not recited to reproue Iacob, as though
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:7669:61"/> he had committed any faulte, or offended either God or his brother: But contrarywiſe the holie Ghoſte geueth him heere teſtimonie, that hee ſheweth vs the waye howe to ſearch after Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly thinges, and that firſt of all wee muſt ſeeke the kingdome of God, and renounce our owne deſires, or elſe in ſuch wiſe captiuate and bringe them vnder, that they hinder vs not from looking alwaies to the principall.</p>
               <p>And contrarywiſe the example of Eſau is ſette before vs (as the Apoſtle ſheweth) to the end, <hi>Wee ſhould not be prophane as he was:</hi> that is to ſay, that wee ſhoulde not bee giuen to the earth: but that wee ſhould thinke that this which is promiſed vs, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to eternall life. So then, wee muſte not iudge of this hiſtory after our naturall opinion: but wee muſt way to what ende and purpoſe it is heere rehearſed, to the end wee may the better make our profite of it.</p>
               <p>Now I haue already ſayd in the firſt place, that God would as it were ſeale his election heere, in the perſon of Iacob: and that hee hath ſhewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the perſon of Eſau, that hee was of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe, that were caſte off from him. It is very certaine that if Iacob had not beene gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſpirite of GOD, hee had beene alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither like his brother Eſau. But wee muſt ſee how the ſpirit of God was rather giuen vnto him then vnto Eſau: We ſhall not find this diuerſitie, but in the onely free goodneſſe of God. So then, let vs knowe that Iacob was led with an holie
<pb facs="tcp:7669:62"/> affection, foraſmuch as God had holden him of the number and company of his Children: as alſo S. Paule ſayth: <hi>That wee are the woorkmanſhip of God, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to good woorkes, the which he hath prepared.</hi> He ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not there of all men in generall. It is true that God hath created vs all without difference: but there is a newe creation in thoſe, whom God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth, and whom hee purgeth from their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked luſtes, to the ende that hee may bring them to him ſelfe, and conforme them to his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo that they deſire nothing more then to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and ſerue him purely. Marke therefore a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde creation which God worketh in his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. So then, let vs knowe that if God reach out his hand vnto vs, to ſhewe vs the way of ſaluation, if he giue vs courage cheerefully to march fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, and ſtrengthen vs alſo to continue therein, that then hee ſheweth that his election is not in vaine and friuolous, but hath it full effect and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. To conclude, when he abandoneth vs, and that we are as ſtrayes throughout all our life, that we forget the ſaluation of our ſoules: let vs know that heerein he declareth his curſſe vppon vs. And ſo let vs learne to tremble, as often as wee ſee men beſotted in beaſtlyneſſe, ſo as they knowe not their owne ſtate and condition, neither to what ende they were created, nor wherfore God hath placed them in the worlde: when we ſee this, it behoueth vs (I ſay) to tremble and to pray vnto God, that he will not ſuffer vs ſo to bee eſtraunged from him: but that he will alwayes holde vs in, and keepe vs,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:7669:62"/> and that hee will imprint in our heartes, ſuche an aſſurance of the hope which he hath giuen vs, that we may beare therin the right marke of his electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if men ſpreade a little waxe vpon a ſeale, the forme of the ſeale will remaine perfect, but the wax hath the ſhape and image thereof. So, when our Lord engraueth his feare in our heartes by his holy ſpirit, and ſuch an obedience towardes him, as his Children ought to performe vnto him, this is as if he ſhould ſet vpon vs the ſeale of his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; as if he ſhould truely teſtifie that he hath adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, and that hee is a Father vnto vs: For aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as we haue the earneſt of his free adoption: that is to ſay, the holy Ghoſt. But now let vs come to that, which is heere handled particularly. It is ſaide:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Eſau beeing returned, he aſked of his brother Iacob, that hee woulde giue him of that red Pottage, and of that meate:</hi> He ſaith it, but this was as it were in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt: and yet heerein we ſee, that he was not ſo delicate and fine mouthed: but hee could doe no more, hee was ſo weary, that he knew not what he did: and therefore he aſketh nothing but to be ſatiſfied. And heereupon he ſayth: <hi>Giue vnto me:</hi> as if hee ſhoulde ſay: It is all one vnto me, whether I eate browne breade or white, ſo that I may fill my belly, admit it were but with Acornes, it is all one vnto mee. A man might heere finde ſome coulour to excuſe Eſau: and it ſeemeth that this might wel haue bin pardoned him. But what? So much the more in
<pb facs="tcp:7669:63"/> this muſt we beholde, that our deſires howe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral &amp; lawful ſoeuer they be, are yet neuertheles to be repreſſed, when there is any queſtion of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly life: for then wee muſt bring vnder euery conſideration, and rather looſe life an hundred times, then goe out of the path of ſaluation. It is not enough therefore that men abſtaine from thoſe actes that are altogither diſſolute and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and whereof they may bee aſhamed, but yet whatſoeuer deſire they ſhall haue, yea permitted vnto them of God, which is not altogither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, yet muſt they tame them, when there ſhall be any compariſon with ſpirituall benefites. But heereof wee ſhall yet intreate more at large. In the meane time it behoueth vs to note this point, that Eſau ſought not after great dayntyes: he ſaw the Pottage, whereof mention is heere made, and he aſketh nothing but to be ſatiſfyed therewith.</p>
               <p>Nowe Iacob aſketh of him his birthright in payment. If he had aſked it of him through ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that it had not belonged vnto him, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it had beene no bargaine: on the other ſide, the malice which he had, could by no meanes haue beene excuſed: and farther this had beene to commit an outragious and theeuiſhe acte, ſo to holde his brothers throte ſhut vp, as to ſay: if thou wilte not forgoe vnto mee, all that belongeth to thee, I wil not giue thee one morcell to eate, rather thou ſhalt periſh. And to what extremitie woulde this growe? But Iacob demaundeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Eſau, but that which was before giuen him. For he was taught that before the two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:7669:63"/> were borne, nowe already this ſentence was pronounced, that God had declared, that it muſte needes bee that the elder muſt ſerue the younger. Iacob then, in reſpecte of God poſſeſſed already through faith the birthright: It is true that that ſtoode him in no ſteede in the iudgement of the worlde: but the queſtion is heereof the right title, that he knew that God had appoynted him to bee the firſt borne, &amp; had declared, that the birthright belonged vnto him. So then, hee robbeth not Eſau of any thing that was his, but hee rather aſketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine that which was his owne: as if hee ſhoulde haue ſaid, Becauſe thou art firſte come out of the wombe, thou deſpiſeſt the ſentence that God hath giuen, both concerning me &amp; thy ſelfe: but yet that muſt ſtand which God hath decreed, it can not be called back againe. For my ſelfe, I alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in this hope, that I ſhall obtaine, that which was promiſed vnto me: but for thy parte, this is to the end that thou ſhouldeſt vnderſtand that I ſette more ſtore by the ſeruice of God then by mine owne life: and therfore ſel me thy birthright. We ſee heere briefely, that Iacob woulde not get the good of another by deceite or malice, neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force his brother to ſpoyle himſelf of that bleſſing which belonged vnto him, but he demandeth, that that which God had giuen him, might be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and ratified amongſt men. Loe then the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of that whiche is ſpoken heere. And therefore they, who will vſe ſo great rigour, to get the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of an other, &amp; to enriche them ſelues with the loſſe of their neighbours, haue not whereof
<pb facs="tcp:7669:64"/> to make them any buckler heere: as wee ſhall ſee very many, who will eſpye out occaſions, that if a poore man, be in any extreame neceſſitie, it muſt needes be that he be robbed. Lo then they wil pray &amp; violently grate vpon him. For the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wil bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with him, when they ſee him in this caſe, &amp; ô ſay they (who liue vppon ſpoyles, as Haukes doe vpon the pray) this man muſt paſſe through my handes. Lo then a poore man who ſhall haue but one fielde or one medowe: if he be indebted or faile to find money to pay, if hee come to ſome Vſurer, he wil ſay vnto him, loe there is no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die I muſt needes ſel you ſuch a peece, ô I haue no money (ſaith he) at this time, &amp; yet in the meane time he will keepe his money in his purſſe, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that occaſion, which is as a robery, foraſmuch as he ſeeketh the meane to deceaue his neighboure. This is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly ſeene, that he that ſhalbe pinched with any miſery, he ſhalbe eaten euen to the bones, of ſuch as onely haue the meanes to ſuccour thoſe that are in neceſſitie. But if ſuch wicked wretches, (as I haue ſayde) will cloke their iniquitie in the perſon of Iacob, it is too too vaine a thing. For Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob ſucked not another mans good vnto him ſelf, nor he ſought not to enlarge him ſelfe to the end to leſſen his brother: but he remayned in the poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that which God had giuen him. The birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right was his owne alredy, in deede not according to the order of nature, but becauſe it ſo pleaſed God. Inaſmuch therefore as he deceiued none, did wrong to no man, neither vſed any rigoure or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:7669:64"/> to drawe anothers good vnto himſelf, we muſt not take any paterne and patronage from hence of thoſe ſame theeueryes and oppreſſions which commonly are exercyſed amongſt men. And foraſmuch as the queſtion is heere of a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual benefit that Iacob ſeeketh not riches, he ſeketh not his commodities, nor any earthly honor, to aduaunce himſelfe aboue his brother: he forſaketh all this, this is all one to him: but hee would haue that which God had promiſed him: that is, that though he be ſmall in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

Touching Eſau his anſwere, we ſee already that which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, and that which we haue alſo alledged: that he was altogither a prophane man. <hi>I haſte to death, to what purpoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall my birthright ſerue me.</hi> In ſaying that he haſteth to death, and that his birthright ſerued him to no purpoſe: we ſee that he was altogither dul and blockiſh, and that it was all one to him, ſo that he might paſſe this preſent life.</p>

For eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like as there are two parts in vs, to wit, the body and the ſoule: ſo the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all life is, when we know whervnto God hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vs, and whervnto he dayly biddeth vs: to wit, that we ſhould be heyres of the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: See what it is to ſanctifie our ſelues, as it is ſaid <hi>Purifie your ſelues, yea all you that beare the Lordes veſſels.</hi> And S. Paule alledging this place ſaith: <hi>Hauing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch promiſes.</hi> That is, that God accounteth vs for his ſeruants &amp; children: Let vs take heede that we cleanze our ſelues from all filthineſſe, aſwel of the body as the ſoule. But beholde Eſau, who hath no care but for his belly, and that he ſheweth very wel when he ſaith:
<q>Beholde I haſte to death, &amp; what ſhall this birthright auayle me?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Yea, but it was for euerlaſting life, it was for an heauenly inheritance: hee hath no regarde to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:7669:65" rendition="simple:additions"/> all this. So then we ſee, that he did eate as a Dogge, or rather as a Hogge that had his noſe alwayes in the ſwil trough, and ſought for nothing but meat. Beholde then the diſpoſition of Eſau, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs in theſe words. And ſo the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle ought wel to be practiſed of vs: when he ſayth, <hi>Let vs not be prophane men as Eſau was:</hi> For ſee what is the cauſe that maketh vs to forgoe the hope of that ſaluation that God hath giuen vs: when we are ſnared in our owne ſenſe, and in our carnall deſires, it is certaine, that wee are quite out of taſte with that which appertaineth to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our ſoules, that hath no ſauour with vs: ſo that there is neither word of God, nor promiſe, nor any thing, which we doe not lightly eſteeme, when we are ſo prophane.</p>
               <p>Now then, let vs take good heede, when we are prouoked with ſome deſire to think, Goe to, God hath not placed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in this world, to periſh as Aſſes &amp; horſes: he hath giuen vs a ſoule, wherin he hath engrauen his owne image. So then, it behoueth vs alwayes to labour and to aſpire vnto this heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly immortalitie, and ſpecially to inforce our ſelues to fight againſt all our affections, and not to bee ſo holden heere belowe, that we ſtriue not alwayes to breake and vndoe theſe cordes, that hinder vs, that we cannot come directly vnto God. Marke then what we haue heere to learne. That wee bee not like vnto Eſau, ſaying: <hi>I haſte to death &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhall my birthright ſerue me?</hi> What? ſhall wee doe ſuch diſhonor vnto the dignitie &amp; nobility, which
<pb facs="tcp:7669:66"/> God hath placed in vs, foraſmuch as he hath giuen vs immortal ſoules: that we ſay we are not of this worlde, our place is aboue, &amp; our right is aboue, &amp; in the meane while, ſhall we reſt &amp; be entangled heere? So then, though wee ſhould periſhe an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times, yet let vs knowe, that God hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a better life for vs, and that there is our ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign good that we ought to eſteme: &amp; albeit that we want &amp; haue need of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitorie benefits, which onely ſerue to maintaine vs heere beneath, yet let vs beare it patiently, and let vs alwayes marke, if I dye, not to ſay I periſh, or I am vtterly loſt &amp; caſte away: For this is but a paſſage by death, to goe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one life to another. We muſt therefore looke vp thither. And this is the ſumme of that we haue to marke heere. But howſoeuer it be, we ſee here how God hath laid open the beaſtlynes of Eſau, &amp; hath ſhewed that he was alredy forſaken of him, &amp; was not gouerned by his holy ſpirite: as the wiſeſt of the worlde, albeit it ſeeme they pearce thorowe the cloudes, yet are they ſo dull and blockiſhe, that thy regarde nothing but that which is preſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and therto they wholly giue them ſelues. We ſhall ſee therfore the wittieſt &amp; thoſe whom men ſo greatly magnifie, which looke to nothing but to builde their houſes. Now I ſay not onely to builde goodly palaces: but alſo to get greate reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes for their children, to aduance themſelues, &amp; to becom great ſtates, to liue at eaſe, to be feared &amp; honored, &amp; that all the world may be conſtrained as it were to paſſe through their hands: and in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:7669:66"/> meane time: as for God, they do not much remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, and they are in ſuch ſorte vnthankfull, that it were much better to be a Hog or an Aſſe, than to be like vnto them. And why ſo? A Hogge hath but his naturall appetites: when his belly is full he will ſleepe, or hee will wallowe in dunge: and he is well contented with it. But men, what deſires haue they? It is certaine that there can bee founde no greater greife to torment them withall more cruelly than their owne appetites. So then for this cauſe, they are in continuall vexation and torment, inaſmuch as they reſpect nothing but this life: and if they once dye, why with them as it ſeemeth, all is deade. Likewiſe wee ſee in all the reprobate, that they haue not any taſte of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly life. And therefore wee muſte ſo much the more pray vnto God, that he will open our eyes, to the ende we may alwayes ſee beyonde theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things, &amp; that we may keepe our ſelues therin, in ſuch ſorte, that we be not holden heere beneath.</p>
               <p>But Iacob contenteth not him ſelfe that Eſau hath ſimply ſolde him his birthright: but hee will haue an othe. Eſau ſweareth: this is all one to him: and heerein we ſee howe God threwe him vnder his feete. For although that hunger oppreſſed him ſo hardly, that he was conſtrained to renounce his birthright, yet when he came to ſweare, and that the name of God was taken to witneſſe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted that God ſhould be his iudge &amp; puniſh him, if he were forſworne and diſobedient, &amp; kept not his promiſe: when all this was doone, and he not
<pb facs="tcp:7669:67"/> ignorant what his birthright was worth, it muſt needs be ſaide, that the deuil had altogither blinded him. But heerby we are admoniſhed, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue once begun to ſtarte away and to turne our backs to God, it muſt needes bee that ſo much the more we be indurate and hardened, to haue no more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of God then brute beaſtes. And when we haue after a ſorte renounced the inheritance of ſaluation, it ſhall come to paſſe that wee ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it an hundred &amp; a thouſand times, yea the deuil wil finde an hundred meanes in one day, to plunge vs in the gulfe of perdition, whereout we ſhall neuer be able to helpe our ſelues. Mark then what we haue yet to obſerue vpon this place: but by the way we haue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider Iacobs abſtinence. Beholde an example of true faſt, and not as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts imagine. It is true, that faſtes are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto vs in the holy ſcripture, for diuers cauſes: For they ſerue to tame our carnall affections: and we muſt ſo cut off our drinking &amp; our eating, that the temperance which God requireth of vs, may be as a continuall faſt, for the whole time of our life: but yet it is ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times required, that we ſhould leſſen our portion. And why ſo? To the ende wee may bee the better diſpoſed to prayer. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, when we are afflicted, there is no queſtion then of banquetting and making greate cheere: if God threaten vs, and that he will ſhewe vs ſome ſigne of his wrath (as he ſayth by his Prophet:) <hi>I then call you to mourning and weeping:</hi> and if we looſe
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:7669:67"/> the raines to our deſires, it is as if wee ſhould bid him battaile and deſpite him. Marke then howe faſting ſerueth to humble vs before God, and to make vs as wretched malefactors acknowledging that we haue offended him,</p>
               <p>Moreouer, the faſt whereof mention is made heere, is that which cauſeth a man to abſtaine, yea from eating and drinking, if the ſame hinder him from ſeruing God, and which maketh him rather to forſake his owne life, then to bee turned away from Gods will. For (as wee haue already ſaid) Iacob ſuffered aſmuch as his brother Eſau: It is very true: that he had not trauerſed and runne ſo farre that day in the fieldes and woodes: hee had tarryed in the houſe after his accuſtomed manner: but albeit that he had made ready his dinner: hee was an hungred and had an appetite to eate, but howſoeuer it was, hee lyked better to abſtaine, &amp; to captiuate him ſelfe, and to renounce his dinner, and as it were his owne life, then to loſe this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which hee had, that his birthright might be confirmed vnto him. So then, wee haue heere to make compariſon betwixt Iacob and Eſau, and to make our profite of the exhortation which wee haue alledged: that is to ſay, that we bee not prophane. But contrary wiſe it is ſayd of Eſau:
<q>That hee did eate and drinke, and roſe vp and wente his way.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpeach heere at the firſte ſight is ſimple, but
<pb facs="tcp:7669:68"/> it carryeth much with it: For it was not enough that hee had ſaide that Eſau, without any further thinking of the matter had emptied his diſh &amp; was gone: but Moyſes ſayth, that he did eate &amp; drink, that he tooke his refection wholly at his eaſe, and that he was wel filled, as though his birthright had beene nothing vnto him. And this is the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which he ſetteth downe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he contemned his birthright.</hi> But before wee come to this, it is ſaide that hee did eate, that he drank, &amp; roſe vp, &amp; wente his way: wherein it is ſhewed that Eſau was abaſhed at nothing, but he was as a Dog, that did nothing but ſhake his eare, after he had eaten &amp; drunk. Then he went his way and pleaded not the matter againſt his brother, as they which repent themſelues, and are better adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when they haue doone any vnaduiſed acte. They conſider, Alas what haue I doone? What ſhall become of me? How farre haue I ouerſhotte my ſelfe? Eſau thinketh nothing of all this: but he leaueth his brother after he was full: he roſe vp, &amp; had no care of any thing. Now therfore we haue heere to beholde how the Deuil, when he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken poſſeſſion of a man, maketh him ſo ſenſeles &amp; blockiſhe, that hee hath no feeling of ſorrowe in himſelfe, no remorſe nor ſcruple, although hee ſee that he be as it were cut off and baniſhed from the kingdome of God, yet hee is no whit moued with it. But this which I haue touched ere while is yet better expreſſed: that is, that alwayes we fall from one euil to another: &amp; when the deuil hath
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:7669:68"/> gotten vs into his ſnares, hee ſo entangleth vs in them, that we can neuer winde out. But we muſt gather this generall doctrine of this hiſtorie, that is, that we alwayes thinke vpon that which is ſaid by our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>That firſt of all we ſeeke for the kingdome of God: and that the reſt ſhalbe caſt vnto vs.</hi> Now when he ſpeaketh of the kingdome of God, this is not onely to be vnderſtood of life euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but this alſo is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>priſed in it. For the kingdom of God is, that God be gloryfied in vs, that hee be ſerued and worſhipped, that we bee his people, as alſo he hath mutually ſanctified vs: as he hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken thereof by his Prophet Eſaie: <hi>Sanctifie the Lord of Hoſtes, and he will ſanctifie you, and will be your ſtrength.</hi> When we ſhall therefore ſeeke that God may bee honored, &amp; that we labour to dedicate our ſelues to him, &amp; to be, as it were liuing ſacrifices: then ſhall all other thinges be giuen vnto vs: that is to ſay (as Saint Paule alſo hath declared:) God will ſhewe himſelfe a father aſwell of our bodyes as of our ſoules. For he ſayth vnto Timothie, that if we walke in the feare of God, thinking more vppon Heauen then vppon the earth:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>We haue the promiſes</hi> (howſoeuer it be) <hi>of this preſent life, aſwell as of the life to come.</hi> It is very true that the promiſes belonging vnto this preſent life are acceſſories, that is, no other then that which followeth and dependeth therevpon: but it is ſo much, that if we leane vpon the bountie of GOD, and ſtriue thither whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath called vs: that is to ſay, to the ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he hath ſo dearely purchaſed for vs, by our
<pb facs="tcp:7669:69"/> Lord Ieſus Chriſt: God will not only become the father of our ſoules, but alſo of our bodyes. Wee are thorowly aſſured of this, and ought to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued in it. But now (howſoeuer it be) if we muſt be ready to renounce this preſent life, and all the commodities which are heere. If wee muſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce our own life, by a ſtronger reaſon we muſt renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to liue. Now we cannot liue heere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eating and drinking: but yet it behoueth that we be ready to ſuffer hunger and thirſt, rather then to be turned away from our calling: and not only this, but when the queſtion ſhall be of death, wee muſt offer our liues to God, doing him this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, and alwayes deſiring rather a pretious and bleſſed death before him, then all the liues that might bee imagined in this worlde, which he ſhal accurſe. Beholde then the rule that is giuen to all Chriſtians, &amp; wherby they are tryed if they be the true children of God: &amp; that is, when the worlde hindreth them not to ſerue God, but they alwayes march on forwards by that path which is ſhewed them by the holy Scripture. When I ſay that the worlde letteth them not: I vnderſtande not onely thoſe wicked luſtes as drunkennes, whordom, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetouſnes, and ſuch like<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo thoſe deſires that are not vtterly condemned: as eating &amp; drinking when it ſhalbe permitted vs of God, and yet if ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and drinking ſhall hinder vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeruing God, then we muſt ſo ſtriue, that our deſires may bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Now this may be better vnderſtoode, by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon experience we haue. There is a man which
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:7669:69"/> may liue in delights and pleaſures, he hath to eate to the full, yea of all maner of dainties &amp; delicates, and exquiſite meates: but he muſt hange his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce (as they ſay) vpon the rack, or rather be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaned with the wicked worlde. For there are a great many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions offred to many, which areas the intyſing baites of Sathan. Thervpon they will think, ô if I were in ſuch a place, I might gather a great deale of good, &amp; afterwardes I ſhould be in great honour, all the world would croutch vnto me: In the meane ſeaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhould haue my table wel furniſhed, I ſhould haue wherewith to nouriſh me to my deſire: yea &amp; in mine olde age, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhould haue gathered togither my liuelode &amp; rents, I ſhuld be aſſured to liue at mine eaſe. But I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not attain vn to it. But wherto tendeth this? Euen hetherto, that I cannot doe this, without beeing in great danger, to bring my ſelf to great wickednes, yea and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vtter eſtranging my ſelf fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: Howſoeuer it be, I cannot ſerue God purely as hee hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded me. But if any man be temped with this, it is certaine that he is like vnto Eſau, if he make choyſe of this condition, which ſhalbe more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the worlde, and in the meane time ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the meanes he hath to ſerue God, and to liue in the peace and tranquilitie of a good conſcience. For hee conſidereth not: I am a weake man, and haue much a doe to holde my ſelfe in the feare of GOD, although, I bee euery day exhorted vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: yea, and thoughe I doe giue my ſelfe wholly vnto it, and inforce my ſelf thervnto: and
<pb facs="tcp:7669:70"/> what ſhall become of mee when I ſhall haue no worde of God, that I ſhall not be exhorted to doe my duetie, and that I ſhall bee intangled with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny buſineſſes and affayres of the worlde? If a man thinke not of all this, and that he make choyſe of a good table, that is to ſay, if he rather chooſe an eſtate whereby hee may enrich him ſelfe, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he ſhalbe reſembled vnto Eſau. Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, when wee ſhall think: Goe too, it is true that we ſhalbe at our eaſe, if we wil forſake God, or rather departe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and wil decline, be it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo litle from a good way. But what? The deuil wil by &amp; by find new ſleights to bring vs wholly to wickedneſſe, in ſuch ſorte that we ſhall be as a deſperate people. But let vs preuent ſuch a danger, and rather let vs loue hunger &amp; thirſt, yea and to feede ſtraightly, and not to haue any great pompe and great ſuperfluitie: Let vs chooſe rather, I ſay, not to haue ſo great an eſtate, and holde our ſelues in ſobrietie, then to be rich and wealthy, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to forget our ſelues, and to haue all our ioy here beneath. When wee ſhall ſo behaue our ſelues heerein: loe how we followe the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our father Iacob. But as I haue ſayd already, the queſtion is not onely of forſaking our eaſe and commoditie, but alſo, when neede ſhalbe, of our owne life. For if ſo be, wee muſt dye to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our faith, ſuche as God requireth of vs, &amp; to glorifie the name of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and muſt paſſe that way: we muſt likewiſe alſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our owne life, and all that belongeth vnto it:
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:7669:70"/> and if we do it not, we ſhowe that we know not, what it is to haue taſted of ſpirituall bleſſings: but that we haue loſte all taſte of them, foraſmuch as the deuil hath made vs drunken with his poiſons, and hath bewitched vs and made vs ſenſeleſſe and blockiſh. We ſee heere by the way howe profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this hiſtory is vnto vs. For beſids that we haue ſaid already, that God hath ratified his election, &amp; hath diſcouered that which was in Eſau &amp; Iacob: heere our father Iacob reacheth out his hand vnto vs, and ſheweth vs that all the pleaſures of this worlde, ought to bee nothing vnto vs, no not our very nouriſhment, when there ſhalbe any queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: to be as poore ſtarued people, that we rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake to eate and drinke, when all ſhalbe made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yea ſpecially, when the ſmell ſhall haue prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vs, that we imagine to haue the morſels alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in our mouthes, and to haue ſwallowed them downe, when we ſhalbe come ſo farre, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that we enter into ſuch a combate againſt our ſelues, that we renounce our naturall inclination, and ſpecially that which is not vtterly condemned amongſt men, if it let vs from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming vnto God, if it hinder vs, or intangle vs heere beneath in any corruptions. Beholde what we ought to doe. And moreouer that wee take good heede on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, that we be not like vnto Eſau, and that wee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge not this, and that as many ſay, ô wee muſte liue. We way well haue our excuſes before men: but when we ſhall come to render a reckoning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great Iudge, who hath declared vnto vs,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:71"/> that hee will haue vs to ſette ſuch price vppon the treaſure of our ſaluation, that he hath offered vs in the Goſpel, that we learne to withdraw our ſelues from the worlde, &amp; that al that is in it be nothing in compariſon of it. But this thing is practiſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſundry ſortes and manners: For when a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man ſhal haue plentie, if he be ſober in eating and drinking, and do not ſo gorge himſelf, that he looſe hoth his ſenſe and memorie, but be alwayes diſpoſed to prayſe GOD, to execute the charge whereunto he is called, and to employ himſelfe to that which belongeth to his eſtate &amp; vocation, yf a man be ſo temperate, he is like vnto Iacob. For he forſaketh to eate and drinke, not becauſe he v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the benefites that God hath put into his hande, but he forſaketh them, in brideling his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, to the ende not to exceede meaſure: and after he alwaies lifteth vp him ſelfe on high, regardyng the ſeruice of GOD, and preferring it before any worldly thing. Againe, if it be neceſſarie that hee which was rich, ſhould be poore: and that he had rather be poore, yea if it were but to eate rootes, if neede ſhoulde bee, rather then to bee alienated from GOD: and that alwayes hee remayne ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt in it, ſaying, foraſmuche as I am an heire of the worlde I oughte to bee well contented: and nowe yf I endure hunger or thirſte, if I beare any neceſſities and miſeries, I will pray vnto God that hee will geue mee patience. And this is the reaſon,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.12.</note> why Sainte Paule alſo ſayth, that he had learned, in the ſchoole of our Lorde Ieſus
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:7669:71"/> Chriſt, to bee hungry and to be full: that is to ſay, when hee had enough, he lefte not to holde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in: and when he had nothing he was patient in his neceſſitie: he had recourſe to God and choſe rather to haue many wants in reſpect of the world then to haue wherwith to growe and inrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and yet to be emptie of heauenly benefites.</p>
               <p>For it is certaine that Eſau had his ſoule buryed in the pottage hee ſawe there, he ſmelt them, and thereto hee layde his ſnoute. And wherefore? Becauſe hee had no other conſideration then of this preſente life. Loe, his ſoule whiche was buryed therein. Novve wee may bee compaſſed round about, with all the goodes of this worlde: but it behoueth that the ſmell doe not ſo allure vs, that wee eſteeme not ſpirituall things farre aboue them, and alwayes to preferre them. Marke then briefely, howe wee ought to apply this doctrine vnto our vſe.</p>
               <p>And moreouer let vs marke well that which is ſpoken heere, that the wickedneſſe of Eſau was, becauſe he made no account of his birthright. And therefore this is a ſigne that we contemne the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of GOD, and as a man woulde ſay, caſt them to the grounde and treade them vnder our feete, when we are ſo much addicted, either to this life, or to our deſires: and when wee can endure and beare nothing: but wil haue all which is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaunt vnto vs after the fleſhe. When then wee will in ſuche ſorte holde our luſtes, it is
<pb facs="tcp:7669:72"/> certaine that we make light accounte of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly inheritaunce. For how ſhall that be eſtemed of vs? It ſhalbe eſteemed of vs (as I haue ſaid alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) when the world ſhalbe vnto vs, but as an acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, &amp; all that is in it, ſhal go as at the taile. But the goſpel &amp; the promiſes which are therin contained, wherby god teſtifieth vnto vs, how he hath adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vs, &amp; likewiſe how he wil haue vs to himſelf: this muſte mounte vppe aboue them, and wee muſt bee rauiſhed in them. And notwithſtanding let vs well aduiſe our ſelues. For if once the Deuill gaine this of vs, that wee become beaſtly in our pleaſures, he wil not put vs in minde for nought, we ſhal ſeke after nothing but this tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitory life, we ſhall do nothing but run vp &amp; downe like poore beaſtes, &amp; haue no marke wherat to aime, as it fell out with Eſau. I haue ſaid alredy that theſe words are not put in in vaine. <hi>He did eate, he dranke, he roſe vp and went his way.</hi> And what a company of ſuch, and ſuch like, doe we ſee at this day? For they which haue their delights after the maner of the world, will eſteeme vs for beggerly momes and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride our ſimplicitie: Wel, wel, ſay they: let them haue their Goſpell, and not withſtanding dye for hunger, and let them be ſuch as haue not a ragge to hange on their taile, and haue nothing to champe betweene their teeth, or rather let them droupe &amp; hang their winges, and be ſo miſerable as none can be more: and let them reioyce in their Goſpell, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they wil, but we in the meane time will haue our ſwinge in this worlde, wee will haue all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:7669:72"/> our deſires, and our table well garniſhed. And aboue all theſe conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of God, which are at this day aduaunced into ſtates and dignities, it is well knowen howe they floute vs, and bleare out their tongue, if men ſpeake vnto them of the goſpel &amp; it ſeemeth to them, that we are as mad men, whiche can not diſcerne betweene good &amp; euil. And why ſo? For they eate and drinke they riſe vp, and goe their way: yea the worlde doth ſo holde them, or rather Sathan hath in ſuch ſorte poſſeſſed them, that Heauen is nothing vnto them, and they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither forget euerlaſting life. We ſee this, and yet it is to no purpoſe to purſue it: For our Lorde hath ſet before our eyes, that this is an horrible condemnation, when we fall into ſuch blockiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to preferre this life, which is nothing but a ſhadowe before that eternitie, to which God hath called vs. For let vs put the caſe, that we ſhould liue an hundred yeeres after our death: &amp; yet what is that? If wee make compariſon (as S. Paule ſaith) with this worlde, it is but a minute <hi>and a figure which paſſeth away,</hi> and in ſumme, <hi>but a moment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now contrarywiſe of what waight ought our immortalitie to bee with vs, which is offred vnto vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and whereof hee hath ſo well certified vs? And yet concerning this life, who is it that can promiſe vs one day? For they who are well fed, they growe therein, and there cannot be a minute to vpholde them: &amp; ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially intemperance choketh very many. And we ſee that men, the more they haue wherewith to
<pb facs="tcp:7669:73"/> do wel, they kil themſelues. And yet in the meane ſeaſon we cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent our ſelues, but (like poore beaſtes) we muſt ſeeke for that which hath no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie: and in the turning of a hande al is loſt. We ſeeke neuertheles for this, &amp; herevnto we are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea wholly adicted, inſomuch that we diſcerne not betwixt that which is permanent, and that which flitteth away: For if we contemne that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting whither then goe we? It is certain that the moſt wickedſt themſelues wil ſay, that this is a madnes: but after they haue ſaide it, they ſhew that they are ſtrayed, and that they do not greatly paſſe for it.</p>
               <p>And this is ſo common a vice, that it behoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that the moſt perfect eſpecially fight againſt it. And the Apoſtle not without cauſe handeling this matter ſayeth: <hi>Bee not prophane:</hi> to the ende to make vs watchful: &amp; to make vs thinke who wee are, and that we ſhould not be ſo brutiſh, as to reſt vpon this preſent life. So then, let vs go further, &amp; that which is heere giuen vs, let vs apply for our helpe, too make vs run on the more ſwiftly: but if there bee any thing that hinder vs, yea though it were our very eye (as our Lord Ieſus Chriſt ſaith) that our eye may rather bee plucked out,<note place="margin">Matth. 5.</note> and wee rather deſire too enter into the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen blinde, then hauing al our ſenſes ſounde to go into euerlaſting deſtruction. So then to conclude, let vs rather loue hunger &amp; thirſt, then to cramme and ſtuffe our bellies, and in the meane time not to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:7669:73"/> regarde euerlaſting lyfe: For wee muſt not bee ſo ſnared in theſe corruptible and tranſitorie thinges, that wee can not alwayes lift vp our ſenſes and affections on high, to the end, through hope to be Citizens of the kingdome of heauen.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs fall downe before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our offences praying him that it will pleaſe him in ſuch ſorte to make vs to feele them, that it may ſerue to make vs there to open them: and that wee may learne in ſuch ſorte to fight againſt all temptations, that if wee muſt indure many pouerties and miſeryes in this worlde (howſoeuer it bee,) that this doe not turne vs to wickedneſſe and make vs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline from the right pathe: but that euery one maye heere reſiſte bothe him ſelfe, as alſo all his deſires, and all his paſſions: and that wee may ſerue our GOD in ſuch ſorte, that if it will pleaſe him to proue our patience in leauing vs deſtitute of meanes, and of the commodities of this worlde: that wee may beare all with a quiet and peaceable courage, vntill wee be receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this bleſſed inheritaunce, where we ſhall not lacke any thing what ſoeuer it bee: but there wee ſhall haue the fulneſſe of all ioy and happyneſſe.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:7669:74"/> Iſaack his father, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming very neere it. For we ſee how Iſaack had more regarde to the ſpirituall inheritance, than to all that concerned this brittle and tranſitorie life. Hee was oppreſſed with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine: &amp; there is no doubt, but that it was not his eaſe to goe into Egypt. But when he was let by an expreſſe commaundement, it was a ſigne, that his courage tended thitherwardes: becauſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie likewiſe drew him: God ſtaieth his iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and hee obeyeth. Wee ſee then that Iſaack lefte not onely a meſſe of Pottage: but hee ſeeing that hee coulde endure much woe for a yeeres ſpace, notwithſtanding hee withhelde himſelfe, and ſought no refuge in Egypte: and remayned in the land of Gerar, which ſpecially coulde not be altogither exempted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pouertie, which was a parte of that countrie: For it is impoſſible, when there is any famine, but that the neighbour and neere places muſt alſo feele it: It may eaſily be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that then there was no dearth in Egypt.

               <p>For there had beene twoo that Moyſes already had rehearſed vnto vs. Aſſoone as Abraham was arriued into the land of Canaan, hee was faine to depart: &amp; this was a very hard combate vnto him, ſeeing that God had ſhewed him that land, &amp; that he had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued great ioy, for that he ſhuld be put in poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therof: &amp; now a little after he muſt be chaſed out, and become as it were a poore vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, and go downe into Egypt, becauſe he found not any ſuccour elſe where. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo withdrewe himſelfe into the lande of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, which was of the very ſame countrie that was promiſed vnto him, and vnder the Kinge of Gerar: not he of whom now mention is made: for all called him Abimilech, which is aſmuch to ſay, as <hi>My father the king:</hi> &amp; this was not only an hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable title, but alſo expreſſed, that kings gouerned not by tyranny, &amp; did deuoure vp their ſubiectes, but had a fatherly care ouer them whom God had committed to their charge. When then it is ſaide that this famine came as the other, this is to ſhewe vnto vs, that altogither like as God had proued the faith of Abraham and his conſtancie: ſo likewiſe he would call his ſonne to the like tryall. For as I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack was heyre of the promiſe, ſo alſo muſt it needes be that he ſucceed his father in that which was promiſed to the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God: For we muſt ſhewe by the effect that we ſo eſteeme heauenly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, to which God hath called vs, that we paſſe through the worlde, and that we faile not, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:7669:77"/> we be afflicted after diuers &amp; ſundry maners. Marke then wherto Moyſes hath regarde, when he compareth theſe two famines: that is, to ſhewe vs that when Abraham was tempted, it was not onely for his owne cauſe: but his ſonne alſo muſte be like him. But by the way we are called the ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes of Abraham and of Iſaack: it behoueth then that our faith be examined, as it ſhall ſeeme good vnto God. It is very true that wee ſhalbe more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded: and that is becauſe we haue not receiued ſo great a meaſure of ſtrength. Marke therefore the cauſe why God ſupporteth our infirmitie: but yet this is not to the ende that our faith ſhoulde bee idle. So then, we are heere warned by the ſpirit of God, that beeing in this worlde, wee muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to many miſeryes, and that wee ſhall not haue an earthly paradiſe, to the ende to haue all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, &amp; to be ſo ſatiſfied that we ſhal lack nothing: but that it ſhall ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times ſeeme that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten vs, that he hath taken the breade out of our hand, and that we ſhalbe in ſuch caſe, as if hee had condemned vs to periſh. When this ſhal come to paſſe, let vs not thinke it ſtraunge, and likewiſe let vs not be as young Nouices: but let euery one of vs thinke afore hand of that which may come vpon vs, and bee prepared to ſuffer all things patiently. The promiſe is well giuen vnto the faithful: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Lyons oftentimes ſeek their pray and find it not, &amp; that they rore out for hunger, yet nothing ſhall be wanting to the Children of God.</hi> Marke then howe hee hath ſpoken thereof, in the thirtie and foure Pſalme.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:78"/>
               <p>And againe in an other place: <hi>All they which feare God, ſhalbe ſatiſfyed with all good things.</hi> But this is not therfore ſpoken as though God woulde fat vp his owne, and giue them whatſoeuer they ſhall deſire: but he nouriſheth them after an other maner. And when he ſpeaketh of ſatiſfying them, this meaneth not that he will alwayes fill their bellyes with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite meates: but wee muſt yet haue recourſe to another place of the Pſalme: <hi>That the poore of the Church ſhall be nouriſhed.</hi> Marke heere a certaine kind of contraryetie, when God ſayth, that he will fill thoſe of his church with breade, and notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, calleth them poore and needy. If they bee poore and needy, where is this promiſe that God wil fill them with bread and with al good things? But we muſt reconcile that which ſeemeth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agree, and in ſuch ſorte that we alwayes depende vpon the prouidence of God, to bee as it were fed by him: In the meane time if he ſhal ſuffer that we endure hunger and thirſt, that wee doe not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore giue ouer to hope, that he will bee our good father to nouriſh vs. And this is the cauſe why we doe praye for our dayly bread.</p>
               <p>Now this oppoſeth it ſelfe againſt all thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſions, wherin the children of the world doe put their truſt: for they are neuer ſtayed vnleſſe <hi>their barnes &amp; cellers be full,</hi> as it is ſaid in another Pſalme. And beſids when they are wel fraughted, they deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite God as though they were without all danger as they thinke: But contrarywiſe, howſoeuer the faithful haue wherewith to nouriſhe themſelues,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:7669:78"/> yet muſt they euery day ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their mouth, as if God ſhoulde put in breade by morſels: and when they haue nothing, yet alwayes they truſt in him, and in his goodneſſe, and hope that hee can ſuſtaine them, with one crumme of bread, when it ſhall ſo pleaſe him: or rather, albeit they ſee no way how it ſhould come, yet neuertheleſſe, that God will finde a meane to maintaine them.</p>
               <p>When therefore it is ſayd, that Iſaack was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen out through famine, this is aſmuch as if God would declare vnto vs, that when we ſhall fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pouertie and neede, that we thinke not, that we are therefore forſaken of him, nor take it as a ſigne that he hateth vs: or rather that wee imagine not, that he thinketh no more of vs: but that as our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſaack endured hunger &amp; thirſte conſtantly, and in the end tryed that God alwayes had care of him, ſo we alſo acknowledge the like. Marke this for one ſpeciall leſſon. And this is that alſo which is ſhewed vnto vs by S. Paule in the 8. chap. to the Romaines when he ſaith: <hi>Shal hunger be able to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate vs from the loue that God beareth vs in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord.</hi> Saint Paule fighteth there, in the name of all the faithful, ſhewing therein that if God ſhoulde cut of our morſels, yea and that we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of all nouriſhment, as if it ſeemed that hee would exclude vs, from all the benefites that hee hath created in the worlde, as though wee were not woorthy to be vppon the earth: yet muſt wee ouercom this tentation there, &amp; conclude, though it be in the middeſt of famine, that God will bee
<pb facs="tcp:7669:79"/> our father, and we muſte content our ſelues with this, reioycing in our afflictions. But in the meane while wee are alſo exhorted by the example of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack, not to be ſo greeued and vexed with famine, nor for other afflictions of what ſorte ſoeuer they be, to the end they make vs to forſake God, or turn vs out of the path wherin he hath ſet vs: For as we haue ſeene Iacob forſooke his meate, to aſpire to that ſpiritual inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, which had byn promiſed vnto him: So now likewiſe we ſee that Iſaack had no regarde to that which hee might ſuffer in that length of time. He ſawe Egypt which was a good refuge, neuertheleſſe he was turned from it. And why ſo? Becauſe God had forbiden him to goe thither. So then, when we ſee that Iſaack was not ouercome by famine, that he obayed God &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook not to be guided by his hand: by this we haue alſo to learne, when our Lorde wil afflict vs with pouertie &amp; neede, that we looke not to vnlawfull meanes to releeue our neceſſitie. And aboue all, if Sathan lay before vs his baites to intice vs, that we rather chuſe to dye of hunger (if neede be) then to withdraw our ſelues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conduction of God: ſeeing that we cannot be nouriſhed but by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall haue all the bread &amp; meats in the world, it is certain that the wind ſhall aſwel profite vs for our nouriſhment as theſe, and wee ſhall think, that we grow, &amp; yet in the meane time we ſhall not be ſubſtantially fed: <hi>For it is not bread</hi> (as it is ſaid in Moyſes) <hi>that nouriſheth vs, but euery worde that proceedeth out of the mouth of God.</hi> Nowe by this
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:7669:79"/> worde, hee doth not vnderſtande the doctrine of ſaluation, but that ſame vertue which God hath ſpred ouer al his creatures. Mark the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what it is that nouriſheth vs: I ſay not only in reſpect of the ſoule but alſo in reſpect of this tranſitory life, Which ſeeing it is ſo, let vs take heede, that we bee not fed by that which the deuil ſhall ſet before vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are in neceſſitie: and canſt thou do this, &amp; art thou able to winde out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence, &amp; haſt thou any ſuch helpe? yea if this bee contrary to the wil of God, that we alwayes remaine ſtedfaſt, &amp; that we wait til God ſhall ſhew himſelf pitiful towards vs: as he that beſt knoweth the meane, although it bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowen vnto vs. It is true that we ſhall haue no ſuch reuelations as our father Iſaack had, God wil not appeare vnto vs from heauen: but this ought to ſuffice vs, that at this day the wil of God is certaine vnto vs: for GOD hath ſupplied that which was wanting to our olde fathers, when he appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: at this day wee haue the law, which is an infalible rule vnto vs: we haue the prophets which are expoſitors therof vnto vs, to the ende that the ſhortneſſe thereof be not obſcure vnto vs: we haue further more perfection in the goſpel. Seeing God then hath reueled vnto vs that which is profitable for vs to knowe, vvee muſte not deſire viſions at this day, but as often as wee ſhall be in any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexitie or doubte, wee muſt haue recourſe vnto the Scriptures: and when wee ſhall think vpon the meanes, let vs marke whether the ſame be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs, and whether God allowe of them. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhall find that the meanes which ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:7669:80"/> come into our heades, be not agreeable to the wil of God, according as it is contayned in the lawe and in the Goſpel, that we then forſake all. Marke how we haue to followe our father Iſaack, yea to ouercome this temptation which is very heauye and troubleſome: that is to ſay, when we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherewith to bee nouriſhed and fed, but a very ſmall pittance. For oftentimes the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers are founde to haue thirtie times more then is neceſſary for them, likewiſe a man ſhal find prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal &amp; diſſolute perſons, that wil waſt and ſpende all the benefites of God: yea, and they will make hauock of them. But what of the poore faithful ones? hauing traueled for to maintaine their life, yet ſcarſely doe they finde in the ende, howe to get their bread.</p>
               <p>When therfore we ſee that God wil oftentimes thus proue thoſe that are his, let euery one prepare him ſelfe thereto, and let vs not be abaſhed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that our Lorde doe handle vs with ſuch rigour and ſeueritie: Neuertheleſſe this is not to defeate vs of that which hee hath promiſed vs, or not to holde vs for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; let vs acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the office of feeding and nouriſhing vs appertaineth vnto him, and that he wil doe it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not according to our deſires and fantaſie. And moreouer when we ſee that God preſſeth vs not thereto, that hunger ſhould driue vs as they ſay from doore to doore, let vs knowe that he beares ſo much with vs, by reaſon of our weakenes. This is the ſumme of that we haue to learne, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning
<pb facs="tcp:7669:80" rendition="simple:additions"/> the example of Iſaack. But heere a queſtion mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> be aſked. Why God permitteth our father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham to goe into Egypt, and forbiddeth his ſonne Iſaack. But concerning this, wee haue to note that God knoweth who we are, what our ſtrength is, and according to this alſo: <hi>he ſuffereth vs not to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aboue our ſtrength,</hi> (as S. Paule hath ſpoken) <hi>calling him faithfull in this behalfe.</hi> God then knoweth that which he hath put into vs, for that which is there of nature, ſhall alwayes be to throw vs downe: but when he hath giuen vnto vs any power of his holy ſpirit, he knoweth whether it be in little or in great portion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; according to this alſo he exerciſeth our faith &amp; our patience, &amp; when he ſeeth that we are weake, he ſuffereth vs not to be tempted ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly. Marke then how this came to paſſe: and this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie which is heere put betweene Abraham &amp; Iſaack, is to ſhowe that the faithful ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be alike handled of God, for this reaſon that I haue alledged. Iſaack was the ſucceſſor of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, he had the promiſe: and in this that hee was tryed and examined by diuers afflictions, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſeene that God made him to paſſe, by one and the ſelfe ſame path: but notwithſtanding (as I haue already ſaid) it followeth not that hee had one and the like rule in all pointes. For our Lorde ſupporteth whome he will, and when hee ſuffreth men to be more hardly intreated, by and by hee likewiſe fortifieth and ſtrengtheneth them.</p>
               <p>Abraham forſooke not to returne to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie of Canaan, after he had dwelte in Egypt: but
<pb facs="tcp:7669:81"/> God alſo draweth him out of Egypt, as if hee had hild him by the hand: For hee might longe time haue remained there, ſeing himſelfe rich there: but he might haue beene hated of the inhabitantes: &amp; therfore God draweth him from thence, he might lykewiſe haue done the like to Iſaack, but we muſt not ſet him a lawe. If any man reply heere, could not God haue giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſwel an inuincible conſtancy to Iſaack, that he ſhould not haue ſlepte there, and could he not haue made aſwell him to haue retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Yes very wel: but can we binde him to that. It behoueth that he gouerne vs according to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſedome, and not according to our fooliſh dreames and fantaſies. Let vs mark well then, that when there is ſuch a diuerſitie in the tentations of the faithfull: it is becauſe God knoweth what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one will be able to beare. And alwayes let vs haue recourſe to this ſentence of S. Paule: <hi>That wee hope in him,</hi> if he examine vs, if he place vs in the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, if he trye vs with many greefes, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he will prouide for this, that we ſhall not bee altogither ouercome or vanquiſhed. Marke wherfore it was forbidden Iſaack to goe into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. Now it is ſaid vnto him.</p>
               <q>That he ſhould dwel in the countrie of Canaan, and that God will alwayes be with him, and that he wil fulfill the othe which he had ſworne vnto his father Abraham.</q>
               <p>This is to ſay, that he would multiply his ſede as the ſtars of heauen, &amp; that in his ſeede all the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. Here we ſe why god ſuffred not Iſaack to go into Egipt: that is, that
<pb facs="tcp:7669:81"/> he might not forget the promiſe which had by giuen vnto him concerning the land of Canaan, &amp; likewiſe that he ſhould content himſelfe therein, and altogither reſt him ſelf there. Now if Iſaack who was ſo excellent in the faith as wee ſee by all his life, &amp; to whom the holy Ghoſt hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſuch a teſtimonie, had ſuch need neuertheles to be ſo bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, what ſhal become of vs? Eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo we ought not to maruel, if our Lord doe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times holde vs as it were chained in, and that he giue vs not licence to roue heere and there: for he knoweth that this ſhall be to caſt vs to vtter confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So in aſmuch as we haue ſo ſlippery a memorie, inſomuch as there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing to cauſe vs to ſtray, ſo as we knowe no more which ſhalbe our right way: this is the cauſe why our Lord giueth vs not ſo great libertie as we would. And likewiſe as often as we are hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den within ſtraighter bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des than our fantaſie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth, let vs knowe that if our Father Iſaack had ſuch neede thereof, we by greater reaſon, who are come nothing ſo neere to ſuch excellencie of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as he, haue greater neede. Nowe in the meane time wee ſee that in Iſaack, which ere while was declared to bee in Abraham. God ſaith vnto him, that hee will giue him all thoſe countryes that hee ſawe, and through which he walked: yea, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding hee ſayeth vnto him: <hi>Thou ſhalte dwel there as a ſtraunger.</hi> Marke twoo thinges, which yet ſeeme contrary. For if God will giue him that land for a poſſeſſion, Why doth he not haſten it? Why doth hee ſuffer him ſo too languiſh?</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:82"/>
               <p>But there is no queſton of that which is paſt, but of that which was to come. <hi>Thou ſhalt dwel there:</hi> yea and the worde whiche Moſes vſeth, ſignifieth to dwell as it were in a ſtraunge countrie, as one that were ſtill going. Loe Iſaack then who had a Lordſhip vpon the earth: &amp; yet had not one foote therof, but muſt remaine there by leaue, and muſt be ſubiect to many troubles and tryalls, which were bent towardes him: and yet hee had not one foote of lande, vnleſſe it were the burying place wherof mention is made before. To be ſhort, wee haue to gather heere, that God would haue Iſaack wholly to reſt vpon his word: as lykewiſe it is the foundation, wherevpon wee muſt builde all the dayes of our life, yea and in death too. For if wee ſhould haue all that wee deſire, what ſhoulde wee neede any more fayth or hope? It behoueth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the benefites which wee waite for from God, that they bee hidden from vs, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that we beholde them onely by faith, &amp; that we do God this honour, to account him ſure in all that he hath ſpoken: although hee ſhewe vs not the effecte and trueth of his promiſes, vvhich vve apprehend not after our reaſon and carnall fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: notwithſtanding vve muſt ſay, it ſuffiſeth vs that he hath ſpoken it, he vvil performe it: When therefore vve can fetch all our contentment from the vvord of God only, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let vs aſſure our ſelues of a right tryall of all that vvhich vvee proteſte, that vve beleeue in him: but if wee vvill alwayes haue a gage, and haue all that vvee deſire, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:7669:82"/> that the worde of God ſhal not be eſteemed of vs, and we can not exerciſe ourſelues, ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly ynough in this meditation. And therfore as often as we ſee God to haue ſpoken to his ſeruaunts, and not to haue ſhewed them the accompliſhment &amp; execution of his woorde, let vs know that this is reherſed vnto vs, to the end that we ſhould learne to cal vpon God, when he ſhal leaue vs in ſuſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, yea and that we ſhal fainte, and be ſtripped of that which ſhould haue beene in our hande: that wee learne to ſay: O Lorde ſeeing wee haue thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, wee ſhal not bee fruſtrate in waiting for it. When God promiſeth Iſaack to be with him, &amp; that he will giue him the reſt, this lykewiſe is too ſhew vs, that the principalleſt of all benefites that we can deſire, is that God haue care ouer vs, and that he thinke of our neceſſities, and that we find him at hand when we cal vppon him. For vnleſſe that wee haue him merciful vnto vs, although he giue vs in al fulneſſe and abundaunce, that wee aske of him, yet it ſhould be nothing: but we muſt beginne at this point: that is to ſay, we muſt be wel perſwaded that God loueth vs, and that hee is fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable vnto vs. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we haue attained to this<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to reſolue our ſelues, that GOD wil alwaies bee merciful vnto vs, and ready too ſuccour vs when nede ſhal require, that he wil neuer forſake vs, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal we eaſely waite for the reſt: but if wee knowe not that hee is with vs: that is too ſay, that hee wil make vs feele his preſence, and in feeling it, will withdrawe vs from thoſe daungers wherein wee
<pb facs="tcp:7669:83"/> are, and in withdrawing vs, will lifte vs vp when we ſhall be falne, wil leade vs there, where as there is no path, and wil there giue vs an iſſue and way to eſcape, where there is nothing elſe but confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: If wee haue not (I ſay) attayned to this, there is no true foundation: but if wee haue once obtayned it, wee muſte ſtay therevpon and hope for the reſte. For if God loue vs it is certaine that he hath wherwith to ſucocur &amp; help vs in all, and thorow all, and he wil doe it. And this is the cauſe why Moyſes beginneth at this poynt.</p>
               <q>I will be with thee.</q>
               <p>And afterwardes he ſayth: <hi>That hee will multiply his ſeede, that he will bleſſe is, and that his ſeede ſhalbe as the ſtarres of Heauen.</hi> It is true, that the benefites which God will beſtowe vpon vs, they ſhall not alwayes fall out to our deſires, as wee haue declared. For oftentimes we ſhall want them, to the ende, wee may be the more egar to pray: and alſo he will try vs, and ſhewe vs that we haue no ſuch affiaunce in him as wee ought: and our vnthankfulneſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times depriueth vs of that, that GOD other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was ready to beſtowe vpon vs: For wee are not alwayes capable to receiue that which he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs. Hee hath an open hand, but we haue a cloſe mouth: that is to ſay, we are ſhut vp in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe &amp; diſtruſt. And therfore ſee the cauſe why we muſt ſo oftentimes wait: but ſo much there is, that if we be reſolued in this poynt, he is with vs, and we are bleſſed of him in that which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be expedient for vs, &amp; we ſhal lack nothing.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:7669:83"/>
               <p>Touching this promiſe: <hi>That all the nations of the earth ſhalbe bleſſed in Iſaacks ſeede,</hi> this was ſpeciall to him, as it was to Abraham: &amp; this reſpecteth our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, as it hath beene expounded. For it was neceſſary that Ieſus Chriſte ſhould be the fountaine of this bleſſinge, the which ſhoulde flowe vpon all the linage of Abraham. It is true that the faithfull which deſcended of him, were bleſſed and partakers of this promiſe: but this was by the power of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. So then, if he had beene ſeparated from the ſeede of Abraham, it is certaine that he had beene barraine and dry, and that he ſhould not haue had one drop of the bleſſing. But at this day, foraſmuch as God would by his infinite goodneſſe, that his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne ſhould belong vnto vs, we were ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the true naturall Children of Abraham: &amp; howſoeuer wee were of the nations of the earth, who were then ſtrayed from the Church of God, and who were altogither departed farre from it, yet at this day we are bleſſed aſwell as they. For if it were ſaide to him <hi>I will bleſſe thy ſeede,</hi> and that God had added nothing, this had at this day byn a very ſlender comforte vnto vs: But when he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>That all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed</hi> in the ſeede of Abraham, we are of that number.</p>
               <p>Marke then, wherein we haue ſpecially to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, knowing that after our Lord Ieſus Chriſt appeared vnto vs, this promiſe is to bee apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto vs. It is true, that it is oftentimes ſayd in the holy ſcripture, that men ſhalbe bleſſed by men,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:84"/> as for example, when they ſhall ſet him before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for a paterne and example: and that men will ſay, deſiring to be bleſſed, ô that God wold do vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me as he hath doone vnto this man heere, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that man there: but the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of S. Paule ſheweth vs, that that which was aſwell ſpoken to Abraham as to Iſaack, was not onely to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode in that ſenſe: but it is ſaid elſe where, that the faithfull ſhalbe bleſſed in God. So it is ſaide nowe, that they ſhall bee bleſſed in the ſeede of Abraham. But we haue to ſearch all our good and ſaluation in him alone, <hi>who is the fountaine thereof,</hi> as it is ſaid in the 36. Pſalme. But becauſe there is ſo great diſtance, and that we cannot ſore vp ſo high, our Sauiour Chriſte hath approched neere vnto vs, and wee haue the liuing waters in him: there wantes nothing, but that wee come to drinke, as he ſayth: <hi>Come vnto me: and whoſoeuer thirſteth, let him come vnto mee.</hi> For I haue the liuing waters, and whoſoeuer ſhall drinke thereof, hee ſhall not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue to quench his thirſte, but alſo <hi>liuing wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall flowe out of his belly,</hi> yea, and fountaines of liuing waters, that hee may giue thereof vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>When therefore we ſee that God will famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly communicate with vs all his benefites, in the perſon of his onely begotten Sonne, ſo much the leſſe excuſe is there, if wee come not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue parte of this bleſſinge the which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnto vs. Moreouer, it is not only ſaid that all nations of the earth ſhalbe bleſſed, but it is ſaid,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:7669:84"/> they are bleſſed: not for that we can compaſſe or attain to this bleſſing of our ſelues, or by our own power and diligence: but it behoueth that euery one be bleſſed in Ieſus Chriſt through faith. For altogither like as he is preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted vnto vs by the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ſo likewiſe we muſt accept him: and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine vnbeleeuers, this is becauſe wee ſhut the doore as it were, againſt all his graces. Then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, that God hath prepared all ſo long time before, that belongeth to our ſaluation, and that <hi>in the fulneſſe of time</hi> (as Saint Paule calleth it) Ieſus Chriſt hath appeared, and hath ſufficiently witne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed, that he was that bleſſed ſeede, wherein wee muſt ſeeke all benefits: Let vs likewiſe come with the like readyneſſe of faith, and with ſuch zeale, that we be not ſhut out through our owne malice and vnbeleefe, to the end God accompliſh not that in vs which is heere pronounced, that we goe not to him to haue the ratification of his promiſe: let vs, I ſay, take heede, that none hinder himſelfe through his owne fault and vice. Finally it is ſaid:
<q>That God will ratifie his othe with Iſaack, foraſmuch as Abraham had obeyed the voyce of God, and had kept his obſeruations, commaundements, ſtatutes &amp; lawes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Heere the othe is yet reiterated, for the greater and more ſure confirmation of vs all: For we can not giue any faith vnto God, vnleſſe wee haue ſtoutly fought againſt diſtruſt, to which wee are ſo naturally inclined: and foraſmuch as we are yet ſo tickle as is pittiful. For this cauſe God ſweareth
<pb facs="tcp:7669:85"/> ſo much the more to aſſure vs. But it is true (as hath beene ſhewed before) that this is worthy of greate blame in vs, that wee ſhould conſtrayne God to ſweare. For we doe not honour a mortall man, if wee content not our ſelues with the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple worde that he ſhall ſpeake, if wee count him not for an honeſt man, contenting our ſelues in that he ſhall haue promiſed vs: but when we ſay, I will that you ſweare vnto me heerein. Beholde this is a greate ſigne of diſtruſt, and will not bee wel borne amongſt men. But if we ſhall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding doe that diſhonour to God, to require an othe of him beſides his worde, muſt it not needes be, that we bee too too villanouſe? But if ſo be that God neuertheleſſe doe in this behalfe take pittie vpon vs, although it bee an intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vice, that we would haue him ſweare, farther then he hath pronounced: yet heerein hee doth apply him ſelfe vnto vs. What can we demaund more?</p>
               <p>And nowe what excuſe ſhall there be, when we would yet that his promiſes ſhould be aſſured vnto vs by an othe? This worde then of an othe, ought to pearce vs to the very heart, as often as it offereth it ſelfe before vs, yea and when there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny queſtion of certifying vs of the good will of GOD, and of that ſingular loue which he bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto vs, But let vs come to that poynt where he ſayth:
<q>That this was for aſmuch as Abraham obeyed the voyce of God.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:7669:85"/>
               <p>It ſhoulde ſeeme heere that GOD attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the accompliſhment of his promiſes to Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams vertue, and to his merites: but we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared already that this coulde not bee, neither ought ſo to be vnderſtoode, as though the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which Abraham yeelded to God had beene the cauſe, why God ſhould be bounde vnto him to perfourme that he had ſpoken: For wee haue ſhewed already that this was altogither free in God. When Abraham was drawen out of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrie wherein hee was (as it is declared by Ioſua:) What was it that mooued him too doe it?</p>
               <p>Afterwardes, when hee kept Abraham to the ende, this was not becauſe hee obeyed him: For contrarywiſe hee had ſayde vnto him longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>I will bleſſe thee, I will bee with thee, I wil be thy large recompence: Thy ſeede ſhalbe multiplyed as the ſtarres of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and in it all nations of the Earth ſhall bee bleſſed,</hi> All this was ſpoken to Abraham before Iſaack was borne: and when Abraham woulde haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his ſonne Iſaack, it was ſayde vnto him: becauſe thou haſt not ſpared thy onely Sonne: but waſt ready to ſactifize him for the loue of me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde I wil bleſſe thee, and this was ſpoken to him longe before: wee ſee then, that that whiche is free in God, and that which hee giueth vs of his meere liberalttie, hee attributeth to the ſeruice which wee doe vnto him: not to miniſter vnto vs any matter of pride, but this is onely ſo muche the more to prouoke &amp; ſtir vs vp with cheerfulnes
<pb facs="tcp:7669:86"/> and courage to ſerue him. Marke then the purpoſe of God: It is not to the ende to rob himſelf of the praiſe which is due vnto him, to the ende men ſhould vſurpe it: but it is becauſe hee knewe that they haue neede of ſpurres, and muſt haue aydes, and helpes to ſerue him, for otherwiſe we ſhould be colde and dull. They therefore which ſeeke heere for merits, &amp; would darken the meere praiſe of Gods goodneſſe to exalte men, as though they were the cauſe of their owne ſaluation, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine they would ouerthrowe all, yea and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurne the purpoſe of God as muche as lyeth in them. Likewiſe, let vs learne that when it is ſaide, that God will eſtabliſh his couenant with Iſaack, becauſe Abraham had obayed his voyce, that it was not to note the cauſe why: but it was onely to ſhewe that the ſeruice which Abraham yeelded vnto him was acceptable to him, to the ende that Iſaack ſhould followe him and conforme himſelf therevnto. Heereby therefore we haue to ſtirre vp our ſelues, as often as wee feele any ſlowneſſe in our ſelues, and when wee ſhall not bee ſo diſpoſed as were requiſite, to giue our ſelues fully to the obedience of God: and that we thinke, What? It is ſaid that when wee ſhall obay him, hee will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte this <hi>as a ſacrifice of ſweet ſmelling ſauour:</hi> and yet notwithſtanding all that wee doe is nothing, there is no ſtrength in vs: neuertheleſſe if God wil honour vs ſo, without any worthyneſſe of ours, muſt we therfore be ſluggiſh, and not thorowly imploy all our powers to his ſeruice, eſpecially
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:7669:86"/> according to that grace which hee ſhall haue giuen vs, and according to our ſtrength? and yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all indenting or couenaunting with him?</p>
               <p>Marke then how the faithfull ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked: and that this alſo is to teach vs alwaies to continue, to walke on in feare and carefulneſſe, when our Lord ſheweth vs that they whome hee hath called, oftentimes make and ſhew themſelues vnwoorthy of their calling. To the ende there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we doe not tempt him, &amp; that we may be ready to receiue that which he teacheth vs, marke wherefore it is ſaid that he rewardeth our ſeruices: not becauſe we merite any rewarde. For (as I haue already ſayde) wee muſte not heere reaſon of that which we can doe: For we can doe nothing at al: and ſpecially that which wee haue doone by the grace of God deſerueth no rewarde: For God can iuſtly condemne it. But the queſtion is, that God accepteth that which we doe of his meere libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, to the end to make vs more couragious. And euery one ought to apply this to his profite, when we feele that we are ſlow to doe wel through our negligence and ſlouthe. Loe then briefely what wee haue to learne heere.</p>
               <p>Nowe when it is ſaide that Abraham obeyed the voyce of God: this is to ſhewe vs the true rule howe to liue wel, to the end that euery one frame not vnto him ſelfe deuotions aparte, as we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to doe: For when men will ſerue God, what do they? They take libertie to liue after their owne deuice, and they contemne whatſoeuer God
<pb facs="tcp:7669:87"/> commaundeth. What is that, that men may call the ſeruice of God in the papacie? That which men haue diuiſed of their owne foliſh braine. For when men ſhall haue diligently gathered all their iuglings togither, which they play there, if it bee ſaid that God be wel ſerued and honoured, &amp; yet they doe nothing of all that God hath commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and that they doe deſpiſe him: It falleth out therevppon, euen as he himſelf complayneth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: to wit, that men for their traditions reiecte that which was ordained for them.</p>
               <p>Seeing then, that ſo it is that we are ſo incly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too ſette out our owne fooliſh imaginations, let vs learne that when the holy Scripture ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vnto vs of liuing well and holyly, when it ſpeaketh of the perfection which GOD allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that is to obay his voyce: as alſo he ſheweth vs by his Prophet, <hi>Haue I demaunded you to offer mee any ſacrifice?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe it is very certaine that GOD had required it? And why then doth Ieremie ſpeake thus? It is to ſhewe vs that God reſteth not there. Where then? <hi>That we obay his voyce</hi> ſaith he Marke then the principall, and where wee muſt beginne, and which alſo is the end, whereto we muſt ſtriue and contende: that is to ſay, that God hath autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to rule vs, and that wee bee his ſubiectes. But notwithſtanding wee ſhall finde it ſtraunge, that is heere ſpoken, that Abraham kepte the Commaundementes, Statutes, Ordinaunces,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:7669:87"/> and Lawes of the Lorde. And yet hee had not ſo much as one worde of all the Lawe in wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. For wee knowe howe longe a time there was betwixt the calling of Abraham and the law: to witte, foure hundred and thirtie yeeres. How is it then that God now ſayth, that Abraham kept his Commaundements, ſtatutes, ordinaunces and lawes? This is, as we haue ſeene before in the 18. Chapiter: for albeit hee had yet nothing written, yet notwithſtanding Abraham was not ignorant of that which God ſhould afterwardes teach his people. For he had two manner of wayes to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne his people: but yet this was not for that in reſpect of himſelfe he was chaungeable. God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not alwayes one and the ſame way too teach the faithfull: but howſoeuer it was, yet the rule was one, whether it were written, or inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to them, whome he reſerued to himſelfe.</p>
               <p>So, howſoeuer Abraham had not yet the Law written, yet he had ſufficient inſtruction, to know how he ought to ſerue GOD. This therefore is that we ought to learne off this place.</p>
               <p>But howſoeuer it bee, GOD in the meane while, ſheweth that if we bee ready to obay him, and to bee ſubiect vnto him, that on his parte hee will neuer fayle vs to ſhewe vs the way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ought to walke, &amp; walking therin we ſhall not be deceiued. But if before there were euer any ſcripture. Abraham had ſtatutes, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, lawes and ordinaunces: at this day by a ſtronger
<pb facs="tcp:7669:88"/> reaſon, when God hath declared himſelf ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly by Moyſes, to whom he hath further ioined the Prophets, to the ende they might there haue a more eaſie vnderſtanding of the law, and ſeeing he hath ſpoken in the Goſpel ſo cleerely, ſhall wee doubt that hee doth not the office of a good mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to ſhewe vs all that is good, right and iuſt? But what? The ingratitude of the worlde is ſuche, that it wil not be ſubiect nor brought into order vnder him: and this is aſmuch as if men would be more wiſe, then is permitted vnto them, &amp; would haue a wiſedome by themſelues, as though it had neuer beene ſayd: <hi>To God who is onely wiſe, be honour and glory.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.</note> When S. Paule ſayth that God is only wiſe, this was not only for him, but this was to the end that wee ſhoulde ſearch for all wiſedome in him. For when wee will not accept this for the onely rule which he hath giuen vs, this is as if we ſhould ſay, God knewe not all that was neceſſary for vs, it muſt needes bee that wee inuent of our owne braine yet ſome what more: and ſay this will bee better. And what blaſphemie is this? O when we ſerue God after this ſort, it is as a man woulde ſay to ſpit in Gods face. So then let vs note that when Moyſes after he had ſpoken of the voyce of God, addeth his commaundements, his ſtatutes, and his ordinaunces, it is to ſhew vs that God will not in any poynt faile all thoſe, who ſhalbe his diſciples, and ſhall come to be ordered by him, to hearken to his voyce. And in deede this is not onely in this place, no nor in that we come to alledge: but as it
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:7669:88"/> were thorowe out all, where our Lorde recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth his law vnto vs, and ſheweth vs that it contayneth all that is neceſſary to leade men right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the way to ſaluation. And thus much concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the words that are touched in this place. So then, when we will walke as it becommeth vs, let vs marke that there is but one onely Iudge, to whome wee haue to render account. But what is it that this Iudge demandeth? Not that euery one ſhould be driuen by his owne fantaſie, or that our good deuotions ſhould be put in the place of his word: but that we ſhould hearken vnto the voyce of our God, and then that wee ſhould be apte to learne, to bring vs in order vnder him: &amp; in ſteede that men imagine, that they haue doone wonders to binde God vnto them, by their vertues and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, that we content our ſelues to be approued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him and his Angels, although the worlde be not contented therewith.</p>
               <p>But now let vs fal downe before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging of our faultes, praying him that it will pleaſe him to touch vs to the quick, that wee may more and more bee brought both to repentance &amp; to humilitie, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to lament before him, and to pray him, that it will pleaſe him to cleanſe vs from all our vices, &amp; to make vs to walke in ſuch integritie, that our life may be fully framed to his righteouſneſſe, and that by this meane, his name may bee gloryfied: when he ſhall haue al the rule ouer vs, and that we ſhall walke according as he hath taught vs by his
<pb facs="tcp:7669:89"/> worde, without adding any thing therto of our owne: and that he will in ſuch ſort ſupporte vs in our weakeneſſes, that we ceaſſe not alwaies to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his holy vocation, albeit we go not on ſo ſwiftly, and run not with ſuch zeale and feruencie as we ought: &amp; that in the meane time we may be armed (howſoeuer it fall out) with his power, to fight againſt all temptations, and neuer to decline out of the good way, albeit wee haue many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions therto. And that he may not only ſhew vs this fauour, but alſo to all peoples and nations of the Earth &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue ſeene the temptation which happened to Iſaack, when hee was ſo preſſed with famine, that it inforced him too forſake the place of his habitation: For this ſhould at the leaſt haue byn, that God ſhould haue nouriſhed &amp; fed him in that countrie which hee had aſſigned vnto him for an inheritance: But if hee would not accompliſh his promiſe vnto him, ſhould he not haue giuen him ſome little taſte thereof? But nowe when famine driueth him away, this is, as if God had forſaken him there, and as though hee had had no more care of him. Iſaack therefore had heere a greate combate to endure, ſeeing hee was as it were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of Gods fauour, which is common to all: For if hee nouriſh the contemners of his maieſtie, &amp; the wickedeſt of the world, making his ſunne to ſhine vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; cauſing the earth to bring foorth fruite for their nouriſhment: what ſhould hee doe for them whom he hath taken into his cuſtodie, &amp; adopted for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But yet ſee a greater temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſeeing Iſaack was forbid to go into Egypt, &amp; that God had ſhewed him a certain place of reſt, &amp; would that he ſhould dwel there, vntil he might returne, &amp; that the dearth were paſſed. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God then had led him thither as if he ſhould ſay, behold a corner to reſt in, which I do aſſigne thee: &amp; there farther, that he feareth leſt he ſhuld be killed for his wiues ſake: &amp; after that he was taken &amp; reproued: mark further theſe toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the wrath of god vpon him,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:90"/> in ſuch ſort that he could not be but in an horrible perplexitie. Nowe it is very true, that hee was wounderful weake, as wee ſhall ſee heerafter: but howſoeuer it was, the iſſue ſheweth, that God was not forgetfull of him. And this is ſufficient. For he will for a time keepe himſelfe ſecrete, in ſuch ſorte that the poore faithfull ones ſhalbe as it were loſt: but this is inough, that after that he hath humbled them, after that hee hath diſcouered their infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, that he ſheweth himſelf altogither to make them feele as it were by effecte, that all this while that it ſeemed to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they were quite abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from him, he yet in pitie looked vpon them. Marke then howe it came to paſſe with Iſaack.</p>
               <p>Nowe in the firſt place it is ſaide that in ſteade of confeſſing that Rebecca was his wife, hee ſaide ſhe was his ſiſter. We ſawe the like in Abraham: But this is maruelous, that Iſaack had not learned this leſſon, by the experience that was giuen to his father and mother: for they were bothe chaſtiſed for their ouer great feare. And Iſaack coulde not bee ignoraunt of it. There is no doubte but his father had ſuch care (as we haue ſeene) to teach his familie, but that he had inſtructed his ſonne heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Take heed to thy ſelf: For I haue beene toſſed too and fro all my life long, the like may happen vnto thee: For God hath yet ſet me foure hundred yeeres before we enter into the poſſeſſion of that Countrie: it muſt needes bee that thou goe from one ſide to another. But I diſtruſted the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my God, and I haue receiued my paiment
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:7669:90"/> for it: yea I was chaſtiſed for it by a prophane king, that had no feare of God: a poore blinde wretch reproued me of my fault, and God made both me and thy mother aſhamed thereof, when we were ſo corrected there. Therfore fortifie thy ſelfe. There is no doubt, but that Iſaack had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch inſtruction: but when he came to receiue the blowes, he had loſt all, &amp; was deuoid both of reaſon and councel, and there is no doubt, but he had ſome diſtruſt in him. For faith wil alwayes miniſter vnto vs an inuincible conſtancie, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt nothing, but that which God alloweth.</p>
               <p>Marke wherein we may knowe whether wee be well grounded in God, and ſtayed vppon his promiſes: that is, when wee ſhal bee in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in any perplexitie, and in any daunger, if we walke on alwaies in the path which GOD hath commaunded vs, and doe not decline therefrom, then he will guide vs in all our wayes. If then we haue this courage, onely to repoſe our ſelues vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon God, and to hope that he will helpe vs: then ſee an vndoubted tryall and proofe of our faith. But if we decline either on the oneſide or on the other, it is very certain that our infidelity bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf, and that we ſhew (not hauing any victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt temptations) that we are not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtayed, and that we haue (as a man would ſay) our ſtragling thoughts. For wee ſee that Iſaack fel to a very vnlawful thing, when to ſaue his life, he cloked the trueth as we haue ſeene.</p>
               <p>This therefore is a token, that hee had no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb facs="tcp:7669:91"/> faith: but that hee had ſome miſtruſt mingled with it. But in this he is not to be excuſed: and yet neuertheleſſe he was a mirrour of all holyneſſe. So then we haue al, good occaſion to hang down our eyes, and to knowe that when wee imagine that we haue well profited in Gods Schoole, yet we ſhall be farre off from our marke. And indeed it ſhalbe a very eaſy matter vnto vs, when we are farre of from all combates, to be the valiaunteſt in the worlde: but when they ſhal approch to buckle with vs, then he holde vs al affrayde. Thus then let vs knowe, that there is not one that hath not neede to pray dayly, that God wil encreaſe his faith, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the remnaunt of his vnbeliefe. Marke this for one leſſon. Now heervpon we haue one good aduertiſement: and that is, that when any danger befalleth vs, or that we feare to fall into any euill: that this is as it were a cloude to dazel our eyes, in ſuch ſort that we knowe not what wil become of vs, we haue no certaine counſaile, &amp; the wiſeſt are ouertaken therin: Let vs not preſume to be ſubtile &amp; ſharpe &amp; to haue ſuch promptitude, to eſteeme that we ſhall alwayes be ſtrong and mightie, that we ſhall haue light harts, and ſhall find remedies in our brain when any trouble ſhall come vppon vs, let vs keepe our ſelues from ſuch arrogancie: but let vs rather acknowledge that God hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the ſpirit of wiſedome and of counſaile, and let vs run vnto him. And when we ſhall bee as it were oppreſſed and that we can not at the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue our ſelues, let vs not bee as thoſe that alwaies
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:7669:91"/> forge and coyne new diſcourſes: but let vs goe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and pray him to ſhine vnto vs in the midſt of darkenes: yea and ſpecially let vs waite that we be not altogither preſſed downe: but let vs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ignorance that is in vs. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as wee haue not by a greate deale ſo muche ſtayednes as were requiſite, let vs both morning &amp; euening pray vnto God that he will guide vs, and ſhewe vs what we haue to doe. Marke then that which we haue to learne by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Iſaack. But heere a queſtion might be aſked, whether hee committed ſo great a fault, ſeeing he lyed not: For we haue ſeene before, that Rebecca was his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſine. Hee might then ſay ſhee is my ſiſter: For the worde in that language importeth aſmuch as of my blood or kindred. There is no queſtion heere neither of the firſt nor ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d degree. So Iſaack lyed not in ſaying that Rebecca was his ſiſter. And yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding al this, he faulted, yea indeed: For God is no Sophiſter, &amp; doth not ſtay vpon a word as we haue declared before: but hee regardeth the intent.</p>
               <p>When therefore wee ſhall haue well painted our wordes, and that there ſhall bee ſome goodly coulour and faire ſhewe to acquite vs before men, all this is nothing: For GOD ſoundeth the heart. And though men can finde nothing too ſay againſte our excuſes, yet this prooueth not that GOD is content therewith. And this which is heere, is a very good &amp; profitable admonition. For how doe men commonly ieſt with God? It
<pb facs="tcp:7669:92"/> is true, that wee wil confeſſe that it belongeth to him to ſearch into our ſecret thoughtes, and that nothing is hidden from him: but yet ſo it is, that we deale with him after the manner of men: and which is worſſe, wee will altogither go beyonde him, &amp; we will bleare his eyes: and we wil ieſte more boldely with him than with men. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though wee haue many ſtarting holes, which might diſcharge vs of blame, yet ſo much there is that we haue ſome remorſe, knowing other men will not iudge ſo thereof, this man is no beaſt, he may knowe my craft. When therfore wee haue thus diſguiſed our wordes, yet we ſhalbe alwayes in doubt, whether men bee ſatiſfyed or not. But when the matter is of God, wee doe nothing but wrythe our mouth, or rather mowe and ſnuffe at God: For we are as brute beaſtes, yea and worſe too in this poynt. But ſo much the more ought we to learne this doctrine: that is to ſay, that God ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not for all our goodly coulers: for they are nothing elſe but breeches of leaues, and this excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not our father Adam, that he came not out too make his account. What muſt we then doe? We muſt ſo acknowledg our faults in ſimplicitie, that we be firſt our own iudges: &amp; when we ſhall once haue found out, that there was ſome crooked and indirect dealing, we muſt acknowledge that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed God. For mark Iſaacks intention, it was to hide his mariage. It is true that the wordes which he vſeth are not ſuch as for which hee ſhoulde be called a lyer: but yet for all that there was ſome
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:7669:92"/> leazing in him. And whye ſo? Becauſe hee woulde not confeſſe his mariage: but woulde that it ſhould be vnknowen, and that men ſhould not thinke that Rebecca was his wife. Marke then in ſumme the thing we haue to learne: That is, that whatſoeuer wordes we haue in our mouth, nothing can iuſtifie vs, vnleſſe that our affection be pure and right, and that wee goe not in any by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathes, to ſtray heere and there. And when Saint Paule condemneth lying: hee addeth <hi>that euery one ſpeake in trueth to his neighbours.</hi> When we ſhall haue proceeded thus farre heerein, ſee how wee ſhalbe holden and reputed true before God. But if there be any ſleights or craftes, and that we indeuour to ſpeake ſo, that it cannot be vnderſtoode what wee ſay, and that it be ſo wreſted and turned, as if our tongue were double, in this wee are already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for lyers. This then in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me is that which we haue to learne vpon this point. Nowe when it is ſaid,
<q>That Iſaack feared leſt he ſhould haue beene killed for his wiues ſake:</q>
               </p>
               <p>There is no doubt, but that hee might thereby alſo haue taken occaſion, ſeeing (as Abraham his father alledged) that there was no feare of God in the countrie: not for that there was ſo outragious Impietie, that neither good nor euil was knowen there. For wee ſee howe the King of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie ſpake: but foraſmuch as the true religion ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not there, and becauſe there was nothing but Idolatrie, it ſeemed rather to Iſaack that all was confuſed. For in deede we ſhall neuer haue a ſure
<pb facs="tcp:7669:93"/> rule, to walke in equitie and right, vnleſſe we haue the maieſtie of God preſent, and that wee be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in with that, as it were a bridle. Nowe when we knowe not what God is, and that we haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but confuſe ſpeculatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, albeit that we haue ſome honeſtie, and though we haue the diſcerning of good and euill, and that wee are not giuen to hurt, nor to commit wrong and violence, yet ſo it is that there is no ſtayedneſſe in vs. For (as I haue ſaid) we cannot builde vpon any other fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation, to haue a firme &amp; ſtable building, but vpon the fear of God going before. Iſaack therefore might haue ſome occaſion to feare &amp; to preuent daunger: but in the meane while he ought to haue knowen, of what force God his ſauegarde was, euen ſuch as it had byn before by experience declared vnto him: For if he had byn wel aduiſed, he woulde not but haue vnderſtood that God had his arme ſtretched out, for to haue ſuccourd him, &amp; that inviſible ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: For he had ſaid vnto him: <hi>Feare not, for I am with thee: I am thy very large rewarde.</hi> It is true that this was not ſpoken expreſſely to him: but that which was ſpoken to his father, was aſwel ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. For he was the heire of that promiſe.</p>
               <p>Seeing then he wayted not vpon God, heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee is reprooued of infidelitie. It is true that Faith letteth not but that wee may apprehende thoſe daungers, wherwith we are beſette rounde about: For Faith ſerueth not too make vs inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And this ſhould be no vertue, to vs to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God: vnleſſe we were prouoked, ſeeing that we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:7669:93"/> cannot eſcape daunger without his ayde: but there is a great difference, whether our feare bee ſuch as maketh vs to goe out of the right path: or rather bee as a ſpurre vntoo vs too prouoke vs too goe vnto God. If Iſaack had thought thus with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, It behoueth that I returne mee to my God: For I haue no other refuge, but to haue recourſe too his helpe: hee hath promiſed it mee, yea and I haue had already experience thereof in my neede. It muſt therefore needes bee that his trueth doe yet declare and ſhew it ſelfe towards me. If I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack had beene come thus farre, it is certaine, that his faith had beene ſo much the better tryed: and his feare had ſhewed, as if hee had beene ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in God beeing weake in himſelf: but when he is ouercome with feare, and farther taketh ſuch counſaile as God condemneth: therein he frameth not himſelfe to the dutie of a faithful man. When Iſaack went thus, heerin he ſheweth he feareth, in aſmuch as hee was not ſufficiently giuen to the word of God, and that his faith was not well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued: but in that he wauereth &amp; varyeth, heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee ſheweth that hee did not ſtedfaſtly truſt in God as he ſhould.</p>
               <p>But now we ſee Iſaacks fault, wee muſt ſo much the rather be warned (as we haue already ſaid) that in all the obiects which we ſhall haue to make vs affraide, that wee alwaies do God this honor, that there is ſufficient in him too remedy it, that if we call vppon him, and after that wee vſe the meanes that he hath left vnto vs, and which hee alloweth,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> without going beyonde our boundes either to the right hand or to the left. Iſaack therefore did no wrong at all to them of that countrye, but to God, which is much more. And moreouer, he is not wholly to be excuſed, ſeeing he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued ſuch a iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his owne head: For although there were no feare of God in that place, nor true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in that countrie, yet ſo it is that true charitie is not ſuſpitious. None had yet done him any ſcath or iniurie, ought he then at the firſte daſhe to haue condemned them? For this cauſe God ſuffered this euill to come vpon him: and yet ſheweth him ſingular mercie: For his wife might haue byn raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, as alſo might haue come to paſſe to his father.</p>
               <p>Beholde a king which is of the countrie of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rar, &amp; yet God bridleth him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doing any hurt to Iſaac, yea knowing wel that he had no ſuch vertue in him ſelf, as was in his father Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, like as we haue ſhewed already: &amp; mark alſo wherfore God preuenteth him, when he had determined to goe into Egypte hee withdraweth him: as it were by force, &amp; forbideth him to go out of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d which he had promiſed him. Wee haue ſhewed already that God according to the meaſure hee hath giuen vs, doth alſo proue vs. He worketh therefore in all men, as in ſundry ſhoppes and by inſtrumentes which are not of the ſame power. And ſo, marke Iſaack who was ſpared for once: but alſo wee ſee how pitiful &amp; kinde the Lord was vnto him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hee looſed not the bridle to Kinge Abimilech to do that vnto him which wadone vnto Abraham
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7669:94" rendition="simple:additions"/> his father. For if we demaund, why it fell out at one time, &amp; not at an other. It is certain that God gouerned this by his wonderful counſail: For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he once loſeth the raines vnto men, it is certain that they paſſe their boundes. And it is ſaid expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he <hi>holdeth the hands of Kings in his hand,</hi> and that he turneth them hither and thither as he thinketh good. So then it behoueth vs to conclude, that the heart of the kinge of Gerar was holden that it deſired not Rebecca: otherwiſe he had beene ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to that concupiſcence, that poore Iſaack ſhuld haue byn therby tormented euen vnto the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt &amp; had byn ſwallowed vp with terible diſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſes: but (as we haue ſaide) God who is faithfull ſpareth his owne, or tryeth them more to the quick, according to the power that he knoweth to be in them.</p>
               <p>Moreouer when we ſhalbe ſo fearefull and ſo weake, that with much a doe, we ſhall bee ſcarſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as a man woulde ſaye) to beare one filip: yet let vs truſt that God wil giue vs ſtrength, when it ſhal pleaſe him to draw vs out to a more hard trial: but notwithſtanding this ought not to make vs careleſſe. If I feele my ſelfe feeble, and that I ſay, ô, God wil ſpare me, for, he knoweth that I can beare nothing: it is certaine, that I ſhalbe puniſhed for my vnthankfulneſſe. And why ſo? So farre foorth as we are weake wee muſt run vnto him, who hath all power to ſupply our wantes. And therefore let vs learne when it is ſaid that God wil helpe vs, and that hee will giue vs ſtrength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb facs="tcp:7669:95"/> all the combates, which ſhall bee directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt vs, this is to the end we ſhould learne to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our ſelues in prayer day by day. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs not be ſluggiſhe, becauſe it is ſaide that God ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gtheneth his, al after as it ſhall pleaſe him to draw them into tryal: but let this ſerue to make vs alwayes to looke more neerely vnto our ſelues: and after we knowe our miſeryes, that wee ſhould ſeeke for remedie, and pray him that it woulde pleaſe him neuer to ſuffer vs to fall in any ſorte whatſoeuer, but that hee will ſupporte vs, or elſe when he will that we ſhall fight more couragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he will giue vs wherewithal that we may be armed from aboue, as he knoweth beſt alwaies howe to giue victory to thoſe that truſte in him, and who fight not but vnder his banner. Marke then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the diuerſitie we reade betwixt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham and Iſaack. Now it is ſaid:
<q>That the King ſawe Iſaack ſporting himſelfe with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca his wife, and that afterwardes he called him, and ſayd vnto him: For a trueth that is thy wife.</q>
               </p>
               <p>By this we may ſee that there was a great deale more integritie at that time, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is at this day, and that whordomes and diſſolute liues were not ſo common. For ſome men at the firſt daſh would haue ſet vp a ſiniſter iudgement againſt Iſaack. It muſt needes be therefore, that men had more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie, then is to bee ſeene in our time. And ſeeing there is no doubt, that Iſaack getting this reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:7669:95"/> amongſt al, that he was no villain nor whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, that vnder couler of ſaying ſhe was his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter caried a whore after him. There is no doubte (I ſay) but when both hee and his manner of life was knowen, but that euery one was perſwaded, that he was an holy man, and fearing God, and that he was not giuen to any ſuch vices and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</p>
               <p>And this is a poynte which wee oughte well to marke: For there is no man that woulde not bee counted an honeſte man: and ſo ſoone as men doe conceiue any euill of vs: wee think that they doe vs greate wrong: and yet in the meane while we regarde not to vſe the meane, that ſhould not cauſe vs to be ill thought of, and how to auoid that men ſhoulde not charge vs with blames and faultes. The meane were ſo to beare and order our ſelues, that all might haue their mouthes ſtopped: that firſte of all the feare of God beare rule in vs, &amp; next that wee haue our conuerſation with men, in loue &amp; in vprightneſſe, euen as God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs the ſame. If we haue this, it is certaine that we ſhall ſtop vp many wicked mouthes. But it is very true, that the holieſt and godlyeſt, men can not many times let the wicked to ſpeake euill of them: For was not the Sonne of GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſubiecte vnto ſlaunders and opprobryes? Was it not vpbraide him, that hee blaſphemed againſt GOD his father. But yet for all this, the Scripture ſayeth not without cauſe, that then wee ſtoppe the mouthes of the wicked, when
<pb facs="tcp:7669:96"/> we ſhunne all offences, and when we doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly labour to abſtaine <hi>from euill,</hi> but alſo from <hi>all ſhew of euill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherfore they that haue ſo great care of their credite and reputation, that they cannot abide to be abaſed either in one reſpect or other, et the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue regarde to the meane: that is to ſay, let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent that they be not iuſtly blamed, &amp; herein they follow the example of Iſaack. For we ſee that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtraunger in a barbarous Countrie, where there was nothing but Idolatrie: neuertheleſſe ſo it is that he is yet eſtemed for a man fearing God, and that they could not rayſe vppe an euill iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him. And why ſo? Becauſe they were conuinced of the contrary by his good life and honeſtie: Let vs doe the like, &amp; it is certaine, that we ſhall ſtop many ſlanders and many reproches. But yet we haue further to note, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was ſuch honeſtie amongſt men, that if a man ſported familiarly with his wife, it was in mariage. But now a dayes all is ſo ouerflowed, that a man muſt ſhut his eyes againſt the greateſt vilanyes of the worlde. Let a man goe into Courtes, ô, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that therein the wickedneſſes are ſo vnruly, as a man can beholde nothing more. And eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if a huſband ſee his wife to bee allured with an other mans eye, and that ſome doe abuſe her there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as though ſhe were an harlot, he muſt ſet a good countenaunce vpon it: for if hee ſhewe any ſigne, that he is greeued therewith, and that hee doe not laugh at it, as others doe, ô, ſay they, he is a iealous
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:7669:96"/> foole &amp; a dizarde. Loe how it is in this caſe: For men are come euen to the heape of iniquite, in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that they haue loſte all ſhamefaſtneſſe, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are giuen to ſuch beaſtly libertie, that there is no more honeſtie amongſt them. And I woulde to God this miſchiefe were in no place elſe but in theſe courtes: But it is euen a deluge or floude, which a man ſhall ſee in all eſtates, yea euen to the leaſt, ſuch ieſtures of incontinencie, &amp; diſſolute wantonneſſe, that it is pittie to beholde. But let vs marke how farre off wee be from theſe men which were as it were miſerable blinde ones hauing no knowledge of God, hauing no lawe writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no nor yet any reuelation: &amp; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they had this honeſtie, that none ticked nor toied ouer familiarly with another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s wife. nor had any geſtures whereby any euil might be ſuſpected, as we ſee heere. <hi>For trueth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>this it thy wife.</hi> And wherevpon doth he conclude it? It is becauſe that vice was not accuſtomed there: and it was not come in vſe nor in poſſeſſion amongeſt men, in ſuch ſorte but that they might eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne betwixt mariage and whoredome.</p>
               <p>Now this teacheth vs ſo to behaue our ſelues ech towardes others, that there bee no vnchaſte lookes, no vicious geſtures: but that we be in ſuch ſort pure from all euill, that euen before men wee giue no occaſion to ſpeake euill, nor yet to thinke euill of vs. It is true that he ſpeaketh here of ſome geſture which was ouer familiar to a ſtraunge man: For it needeth not that we ſhould bee ſo au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:97"/> that wee can not liue togither, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing occaſion of euill: and yet in the meane time liuing in familiaritie, yea and ſporting our ſelues with all honeſtie, ſhewing that wee haue chaſte hartes, chaſte eyes, and all our ſenſes chaſte.</p>
               <p>But when Iſaack played thus with his wife, he made ſome ſigne of a huſband to his wife: ſo that it might bee iudged either this man is a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, or elſe hee muſt needes be her huſbande. Nowe to think him a whoremonger, they could not, becauſe he had behaued himſelfe honeſtly in the feare of God, and with the good wil of euery one in the countrie of Gerar: he muſt therfore be eſteemed for her huſband. But heerevpon Iſaack confeſſeth his faulte: but hee confeſſeth it allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that he feared, leſt he ſhoulde haue beene kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Here things are rehearſed more briefely, then we haue ſeene before. For Abraham was rebuked more ſharpely: &amp; likewiſe he maketh a more long excuſe therof. <hi>I did knowe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there was no feare of God in this Countrie.</hi> Onely Iſaack ſayeth, <hi>I feared leaſt they would kil mee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he ſheweth heere that although Rebecca were his ſiſter, neuertheles ſeeing that his purpoſe was to cloke the trueth: it was to be condemned. So likewiſe, when we will be very ſubtile for a time, let vs not bee ſo obſtinate as altogither too maintaine all that wee haue ſayde and done (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be ſome fault in vs:) but let vs frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge it. For Iſaack might haue ſayd, yea, ſhee is my ſiſter. But notwithſtandinge
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:7669:97"/> that which he had ſayde, he addeth that he was to be blamed, as alſo Abimilech did: For hee ſawe iuſt cauſe to condemne Iſaack, and therefore hee ſayth vnto him,
<q>Wherefore haſte thou doone this thinge?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe wee haue to note on the one ſide, that which was alleadged before: that is to ſay, that God had reproued and chaſtiſed the kings becauſe of his ſeruauntes, albeit they were but a fewe in number, albeit they were as poore wandring peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the lande of Canaan. And ſeeing GOD maintained their quarel, and ſet himſelfe againſte all the violence and euill that could bee doone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them: heereby hee ſheweth the ſingular fauour that he did beare vnto them. And alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet addeth, that for this cauſe he ſayth: <hi>Touch not mine annoynted, and doe my Prophetes no harme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that there was in Abraham and Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack excellent vertue and holyneſſe: but howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it be, yet ſo it is that we at this day are alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted to bee vnder the keeping of God, and we ſucceede to all the promiſes which were giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. So then, though we ſhalbe neuer ſo ſmall a number, and as a poore deſpyſed people, as Sheepe in the throte of Wolues, yet let vs not doubt, but that GOD hath wherewith to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende vs, and that hee will diſplay his power, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as ſhall bee neceſſary, yea and that againſt the mightieſt Kings of the world. For ſometimes
<pb facs="tcp:7669:98"/> God hath indeede ſuffred that thoſe of the meaner and common ſorte of people haue vexed and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted his ſeruants, as we ſhall ſee heereafter, &amp; that very ſhortly. Which what ſoeuer it be, when he hath declared that he foreſeeth the warre, &amp; that hee ſetteth him ſelfe in order againſt the Kinges: Heereby hee hath ſhewed that the life of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants is deere and precious vnto him. Let vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hope the like, and wee ſhall not be deceiued. And when we ſhall ſee the mightieſt of the world to be our enemyes, and ſhall dayly heare rumours of many tumults &amp; troubles: let vs not doubt, but that our Lord wil remedie all, &amp; wil alwayes be our buckler to put back al our blowes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhall be moſte like that they muſt fall vpon our heades. Loe what we haue to put in practiſe by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſaack. And although heere God afflicted not Abimilech as before, &amp; that he reproued him not as he had doone the king of Egypt: neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he keepeth him bridled, and holdeth him as it were in fear: ſo that although Rebecca were faire, yet it fell ſo out: that the king of the countrie deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her not, no albeit hee imagined that it had byn laweful for him to haue taken her to wife. Loe then on the one ſide what we haue to mark: on the other this, that neuertheleſſe God humbled Iſaack &amp; ſuffred not his infidelitie to remaine altogither vnpuniſhed: yet the puniſhment is very gentle, But howſoeuer it was, he was reformed. Nowe if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing had happened vnto Iſaack, and that it had not beene perceiued that Rebecca had beene his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7669:98"/> wife, he had not returned from it, neither had hee euer remembred his fault which hee had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and ſpecially he had pleaſed himſelfe heerein, bicauſe the euent was good and as he would haue wiſhed, and therfore he woulde haue thought that God woulde haue allowed it. For men when their faultes are not ſhewed them, flatter and harden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in them. But God woorketh our good and ſaluation when hee maketh vs to feele oure ſinnes, and correcteth vs in ſuch ſorte, that wee are euen compelled to thinke vpon them. Marke then how it fel out herein to Iſaack. It is very true that God did beare with him very much, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſuffred no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be attempted againſt his wife, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry king of the countrie called ſo gently for him, and complained to him as too his equal and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnion. Loe a wonderful ſupporte: &amp; hereby we ſee that God hath pitie vppon his, not trying them further then they are able to beare. But whatſoeuer it is, yet ſo it is that Iſaack commeth too acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his ſinne. And who is iudge thereof? euen a poore panim, an Idolater. God might rather haue ſent an Angel from heauen, or elſe haue giuen him ſome reuelation to haue ſaid vnto him, what dooſt thou? But hee leaueth him there: For hee was not woorthie too bee taught ſo honorably, but the blinde ones muſt diſcouer his euill and condemne him.</p>
               <p>Loe then, the ſhame that was done vntoo him, too the ende that hee might be the more humbled thereby, and too the ende that he might learne for
<pb facs="tcp:7669:99"/> euer after, better to truſt in God, and no more to fall into that fault. This is that we haue to marke. And with all let vs take good heed vnto ourſelues, and let vs not care that men reproue vs: but let vs take in good parte all correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s that God ſendeth vs by his word. For what honor doth he vnto vs, when he prouoketh vs to come vnto him, &amp; when with doctrine he ioyneth exhortations? And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he ſeeth that we are too ſlow, and beſides that we are as it were incorrigible, he vſeth more ſharp reprehenſions. But whatſoeuer it be, all this is doone in his name, that when wee reade in the holy Scripture, and that we come to the Sermon, and that there he ſummoneth vs, hee is alwayes our Iudge.</p>
               <p>And loe, alſo why our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the preaching of the Goſpell ſayeth: <hi>When the holy Ghoſte ſhall come, he ſhall iudge the worlde.</hi> The ſpirit of God therefore exerciſeth his iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vpon vs: and to what ende? It is to the ende that when wee haue beene condemned, ſo that wee doe paſſe willinge condemnation, and that wee bee apte to learne, and that wee aſke par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, he is ready to giue vs. So then, ſeeing that GOD hath doone vs this honour to iudge vs as it were in his houſe, and priuately by our ſelues: when hee ſheweth vs our faultes, are not wee ouermuch hardened, if wee doe not bowe downe our necke, and become apte to learne, and bee ready to bee refourmed by him? For if wee will rebell ſo againſt him, God will ſuffer
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:7669:99"/> that we come to an other ſchoole, &amp; that euen the wicked and vnbeleeuers condemne vs. We ſhal finde very many euen in this caſe, that fret them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues and gnaſhe their teeth, if a man ſcratch their ſcabbes &amp; rub them on the gall, when they come to the Sermon. For ſee their replyes: was the Scripture made to ſpur poore people in ſuch ſort? and is this the manner to teach, to cry out after ſuch a faſhion? It ſeemeth that he woulde lighten againſt vs. But in the ende God teacheth them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another ſorte: that is, that his trumpet muſte ſounde, and that their ſhame muſt bee publiſhed in euery place, and in the ende they muſt goe to the ſchoole of the Gibet. And moreouer when wee make not our profite of the corrections which are dayly ſet before vs, it muſt needes be that wee bee condemned an hundred miles off, &amp; that by good right. But if heerein wee ſuffred alone, there were no daunger: the worſte is that the name of God is blaſphemed through our wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>So then, let vs learne by this example to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo tractable &amp; apte to be taught &amp; wrought vppon, that when GOD ſhall reprooue vs, wee willingly ſuffer our ſelues to bee condemned of him, and that we be aſhamed of our ſelues: to the ende that our ſhame and infamie be not diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and laide open to the whole worlde. Loe then what we haue farther to learne of this place. But it is ſaide that Abimilech complayning to Iſaack added.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7669:100"/>It was not farre off, that ſome of the people had not lien by thy wife: and thou cauſed greate euil to come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vs.</q>
               <p>Concerning the firſt pointe, heere Iſaack is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued, of his inconſideration and follie. For that aſmuch as was in him, hee layde his wife open to be defyled. And why ſo? Wee haue ſeene bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the huſband ought to be as a vayle or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerture to his wife. When a woman ſhal be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed, and that her huſband ſhall liue with her doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his duetie, this is to the end, ſhee may be there as it were in ſauegarde, and that none come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue nor defile her. Now therfore Iſaack, for the diſcharging of his dutie, ought to haue beene as a vaile or couerture to his wife: that is to ſay, vnder the name of a huſband and of mariage: he ought to haue let that none ſhould haue attempted to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawe her, whether it were to haue her to wife, or after any other manner: For mariage is as a ſaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde, (as wee haue ſaide) and God woulde haue it honoured in all ages. And although adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers woulde abandon it, as Swine and Aſſes: yet notwithſtanding they haue alwayes had remorſe in it: and euermore euen amongſt he Panims, adulterers went not vnpuniſhed. It is knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that if euer any thing in this world was priuiledged it was mariage: yea, &amp; thefts &amp; other crimes ought a great deale rather to bee borne with, then ſuch enormities: to wit, when the couenant &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:7669:100" rendition="simple:additions"/> which God hath dedicated in his name, to the ende it ſhould be holy, as it were ſeparated from prophanation, is violated.</p>
               <p>When therefore this was violated, the Pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nims knewe that it was ſo greate an abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that in no wiſe it ought to bee borne with, Now therefore by the way, Abimilech findeth faulte with Iſaack, concerning this, that hee had thus proſtituted his wife, aſmuch as lay in him. And we are taught by this doctrin to meete with daungers afore hand, and not to tempte God by our raſhneſſe and follie. Let vs take good heede therefore howe wee cloke euill, and (as a man would ſay) ſhut the doore againſt God: ſo that through our raſheneſſe and vnaduiſedneſſe God be offended. Loe then the wiſedome which wee ought to haue: and therefore becauſe we haue it not, we muſt aſke it of God. But now for the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde matter Abimilech ſayth:
<q>Thou haddeſt made great euill to come vpon vs.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And howe? when any of the people had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted adultery, &amp; that he had ſo offended, what greefe ſoeuer it had beene, hee ſhould onely haue deſerued to be puniſhed: and ought then a whole countrie to haue anſwered it? Nowe we ſee heere that a miſerable heathen, an vnbeleeuer, and a poore blinde perſon, knewe that the land ſhoulde be defiled by an adulterer: and that if this remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnpuniſhed, notwithſtanding before God, loe an whole people culpable therein, in reſpect of
<pb facs="tcp:7669:101" rendition="simple:additions"/> the temporall puniſhment. It is true that God knoweth how to turne the chaſtiſements that hee ſendeth to them that are innocent from that faulte to their profite: For if they ſuffer, which conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not vnto the euill, this ſhall not bee altogither as if they had beene faultie: But God turneth this to their ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. In the meane while ſo it is that he neuer chaſtiſeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without cauſe: if we ſee it not now with our eye, yet when all thoſe regiſters ſhalbe opened, then we ſhall finde, that God hath not gone (as they ſay) indirectly and awry. And when hee ſendeth generall puniſhmentes vpon a whole people, for one particular fault as it ſemeth, neuertheleſſe he knoweth well that all bee not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent therein, as it is expreſſely ſaid heere, and as alſo Abimilech vnderſtoode. For when adulter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> are committed, and be not puniſhed, loe an infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which creepeth ouer the whole land: but ſhall we yet ſay that a man is innocent therin, when we cloſe our eyes, &amp; when we ſuffer all this to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowe? Although a man be no iudge but a priuate perſon, yet he ought to oppoſe himſelf aſmuch as lyeth in him.</p>
               <p>Nowe on the otherſide there is not any one, but he ſpreadeth the ſayle in ſteade that hee ſhould let the euill: if wee had the courage and zeale of God, we would procure that he might bee ſerued and honoured, as he is woorthy. But this wee doe not: there is a certaine faintneſſe and ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in all. To be ſhort, vices neuer raigned, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:7669:101"/> had ſwaye in any Countrie, but bothe greate and ſmall were partakers therein, by reaſon of their too much patience or diſſimulation or coldeneſſe. Marke then why God puniſheth ſinnes not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe.</p>
               <p>But moreouer concerning adulterie, wee ſee what a miſerable Heathen hath pronounced. Let vs therefore bee aſhamed when ſuch a greate euill ſhall raigne in the middeſt of vs: and let vs know, that there ſhal neede no other Iudge to condemne vs, vs (I ſay) that haue beene baptiſed in the name of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, when we ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſuch filthyneſſes &amp; infections, ſeeing a poore miſerable blinde Heathen, knewe well what hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous enormitie there was in ſuch a vice. Loe then what we haue to learne, that wee may make our profite of this place. And farther, let vs learne to honour Mariage, ſeeing God hath dedicated it, and that it is a couenaunt which he hath conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated in his name: that alſo it bee maintained in his honour and dignitie, and that bothe Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes and Wiues dwell in ſuch honeſtie one with the other, that eche one may gouerne their houſes in peace and quietneſſe, and that there bee no looſneſſe amongſt vs: but that wee knowe that we haue better profited in the Schoole of GOD, then our Father Iſaacke had doone in this poynt, foraſmuch as hee declined therein.</p>
               <p>But now let vs proſtrate ourſelues before the high maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging our
<pb facs="tcp:7669:102"/> offences, praying him that it will pleaſe him, to make vs feele the infirmities &amp; vices that are in vs, to the end that we may bee diſpleaſed therwith, in ſuch ſorte, that we may fight againſt them, and not to giue our ſelues any libertie therein: and when we haue offended, that we may bee touched with ſuch repentaunce, that we may returne to him, and mourne for them, vntill he haue reformed vs by his holy ſpirit, and haue drawen vs into a good way, after that we ſhall haue ſtrayed from it. And that withall he would in the meane while ſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porte vs in our weakeneſſe, that we neuer leaue to be his Children, albeit we honour him not as our father, as were meete. And that he will not onely ſhewe vs this fauour, but alſo to all peoples &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>EE haue ſeene howe God had pittie vppon Iſaack, althoughe hee was woorthy to haue beene forſaken in the time of his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie: For this was a ſingular fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, that Rebeccaes chaſtitie was kept: becauſe Iſaack had giuen it ouer, &amp; aſmuch as was in him forſaken it, for the ſauegarde of his owne life. Loe a diſtruſt which deſerued rather ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere chaſtiſement: but yet would God ſupporte him, and be the protector of his wife, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was forſaken. Now it is ſaid heere, that God
<pb facs="tcp:7669:103"/> ſtretched out his mercy farther: that is to ſay, that he would haue Iſaack to be in ſafetie for the time to come, and that none ſhould moleſt him either in his owne perſon, or concerning his wife. And in very deede it muſt needes be that this prouiſion was frely giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: For it might haue byn layd in his diſh that he had not greatly paſſed that his wife had byn put to ſhame and reproch. And this was to cauſe him euery day to haue many quarrels. But heerin God tryeth him: and yet he vſeth the King of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, to the end he might be in reſt, to the end that none ſhuld come to aſſaile him. It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordained that none ſhal touch him vpon pain of death. Now this was don by ſpecial priuiledge according to that we haue aleaged out of the Pſal. That God for the fauour he did beare to Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Iſaack, <hi>euen chaſtiſed Kings &amp; rebuked peoples:</hi> but yet ſo much as we may gather that Abimilech, beeing ſeazed with feare, made a decree the which was very right. And why was not this lawe perpetual? Becauſe that men who haue not the liuely roote of the feare of God, doe nothing but by force and violence, there is no holde nor conſtancie in them, as we ſhal finde oftentimes. But in aſmuch then as Abimilech perceiued, that if Iſaack were offended or that any did him any wrong, that this ſhoulde not remaine vnpuniſhed, &amp; that God would take vengeaunce of it: Loe why he was thus brideled.</p>
               <p>Now this is rehearſed vnto vs aboue all, to the ende wee might knowe, how God hath kept his owne, though they haue dwelt amongſt wicked
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:7669:103"/> &amp; cruel people, as it were amongſt ſauage beaſtes: neuertheleſſe hee hath mayntained them by his power: &amp; this is to the end that we likewiſe ſhuld truſt in him. For the goodneſſe of God, which he vſed towards our olde fathers, is not only rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto vs, to the end that we ſhould know that he was then pitifull towards them which truſted in him: but that we ſhould not doute, that he wil ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vs to be moleſted at this day, ſo that wee haue our refuge vnto him: and when we knowe that he will be on our ſide, that we be alſo certaine that he wil maintaine our parte, and that his protection wil be inough for vs, againſt whatſoeuer, men ſhal be able to attempt or deuiſe againſt vs.</p>
               <p>When therfore we ſhal haue ſuch an affiaunce, the example of Iſaack which is here rehearſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, ought too ſerue vs for an inſtruction, as if God ſhould ſhew vs his hand ſtretched out, to help and ſuccour vs in our neede. And ſpecially when our enemyes ſhalbe ſtrong and mightie, and that nothing ſhalbe able to let them here belowe, from oppreſſing vs, then let vs knowe that God wil not ceaſe to put to his helping hand. For we knowe what he hath ſaide by his Prophet Eſay touching his Churche, that it is more precious vnto him, than all the Realmes and Empires of this world.</p>
               <p>Nowe admitte wee be neuer ſo much deſpyſed of worldlings, that wee ſeeme not woorthy too them (as a man woulde ſay) to be caſte too the Dogges: Yet howſoeuer it be, foraſmuch as God hath once declared that wee are his flock, and that
<pb facs="tcp:7669:104"/> he hath taken vs into his charge, let vs aſſure our ſelues, that he wil not fayle vs, when we ſhall bee aſſaulted of them who torment vs, and to whome it ſeemeth, that God muſt not touch them. But moreouer Moyſes addeth:
<q>That Iſaack ſowing, he gathered an hundred meaſures.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That is to ſay, an hundred times aſmuch as hee ſowed. Heere a queſtion might be aſked, ſeeinge Iſaack had not one foote of land, how hee coulde ſowe. But ſome imagine that hee had purchaſed ſome there: but this were againſt all reaſon. For it muſt bee that the fathers content them ſelues, with the promiſe which was giuen them, and that they dwell in the land of promiſe as ſtraungers. And in deede, it is ſaid ſoone after, that Iſaack pitched his tentes, to declare that he had no certain houſe nor building. We ſee therefore that he was a vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonde in earth, as was his father Abraham: but he might well hyer ſome land to ſowe therin: For he had a great familie: as we ſawe Abraham him ſelfe had, who gathered out of his houſe more then foure hundreth choſen men, to enter into bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel. Iſaack had not much diminiſhed it as wee ſee: likewiſe it muſt be that he could not bee much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, eſpecially dwelling in a ſtraunge country: he had hyred ſome farme or taken ſome lande to ſowe therin: according as we knowe that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient fathers, although God had inriched them, yet they ceaſed not to giue them ſelues to laboure both they and their houſholde. For although they
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:7669:104"/> had both riches and commodities, yet they abuſed not thoſe benefits that God had ſo bountifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them, in pompes nor in Idlenes too become Kinges: but to maintaine alwaies them ſelues in the meane eſtate. Marke then briefely that we haue to learne, when Iſaack hauing hired ſome poſſeſſion ſowed therein. And this is rehearſed of Moyſes becauſe he addeth, that GOD bleſſed him therein, and made him ſo to proſper, that hee gathered in an hundred folde. But we ſhall finde it ſtraunge in this countrie, which was ſo hungry and as it were barren in compariſon of Iudaea and Syria, and of thoſe Countryes there aboutes: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when he ſpake of an hundred folde, for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the thing may ſeeme incredible vnto vs: becauſe we eſteeme that which is ſpoken vnto vs according to that we haue ſeene.</p>
               <p>But it is not without cauſe that our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte, declareth this vnto vs by a ſimilitude, taken from the ſeede which is ſowen: although he ſpake to another purpoſe: but notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he ſayth that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> men ſhal ſow, one parte falleth into the path, and the foules of the ayre deuoure it: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhall fall among ſtones, and this ſhal take no roote: for it hath no nouriſhment: The other parte ſhall be choked among buſhes and thornes: <hi>But that which falleth into good ground</hi> (ſayth hee) <hi>ſhall bring fruite, one thirtie, the other ſixtie, and the laſt an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred folde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we come thus farre (as I haue ſayd) we cannot be perſwaded therein, vnleſſe the ſonne of
<pb facs="tcp:7669:105"/> God had ſpoken it. But the auncient fathers, who haue written of the land of Chaldaea, and eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue bin in the ſame place, &amp; know it thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they ſay that the ordinarie increaſe was Lxxx. &amp; an C. But here bicauſe he ſpake of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try of the Philiſtines which was fertile, but not as Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea, therefore Moiſes reherſeth that, for a ſingular gift which God gaue vnto Iſaack, that hee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth an hundreth fold. Loe here a ſigne of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God vppon Iſaack, yea concerning that, which belonged vnto this tranſitorie life. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the auncient fathers alwaies reſpected the heauenly inheritance, and bent al their affections thitherward: yet notwithſtanding beeing mortall men, they needed that God ſhoulde giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome taſte of his goodnes in this world. For that which S. Paule ſaith,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</note> hath alwaies place here: <hi>That the feare of God hath the promiſes not onely of euerlaſting life, but alſo of this preſent life.</hi> While we are in this life God wil not giue vs the fulnes of thoſe bleſſings he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vs: For in very deed, we woulde haue our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe here, and we would caſt our eyes no further but al our ſenſes would be cleane glutted, if GOD ſhould giue vs in al reſpects ſuch abundance as we require, &amp; therfore he giueth vs onely a little taſte of his goodnes, to the end to draw vs on further. But what though? yet ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee but in parte acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that God is our father not only by the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie that we haue thereof from his mouth, but alſo by thoſe bleſſings which he liberally beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vppon vs. And heere wee beholde both theſe things, in this hiſtory which Moſes ſetteth down:
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:7669:105"/> that is to ſay, that God bleſſeth his owne, in ſuch ſorte, that they haue occaſion to reioyce in him: &amp; yet in that he deuideth their morſels in ſuch a portion, that they be alwayes in mourning whilſt they are in this worlde, and thereby are occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to caſt their eyes farther. For mark our father Iſaack, he proſpereth, he increaſeth, and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth mightie, ſo ſaith Moyſes: &amp; he ſaith not only that God bleſſed him at once: but that he multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in ſuch ſort that he always grew &amp; waxed richer and richer. But on the other ſide he addeth:
<q>That the Philiſtines enuyed him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wee ſee that Iſaack had ſuche cauſe too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in God for the proſperitie which was giuen vnto him, that yet notwithſtanding God awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and mixed his ſweete meate with ſome ſower ſauce. This was a great cauſe of ioy vnto him, when GOD did ſo ſenſibly multiply him. It was as it were a looking glaſſe to all the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, wherin to behold what it was to ſerue god: yet notwithſtanding this turneth to his trouble &amp; cauſeth him to be moleſted. We ſee the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how God tempereth his benefites which he beſtoweth libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vpon his children (I ſay, the temporall bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which concerne this life) that they can neuer ſettle them ſelues and reſt therin. But yet here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a queſtion might be aſked, why God cauſed Iſaack ſo to proſper, that the inhabita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhuld riſe vp againſt him. Had it not byn much better for him that he had continued in a meane e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, &amp; had liued quiet vnder his tent then to be ſo inriched that euery one ſhuld war againſt him, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:7669:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> that they coulde not abide him, fearing leaſt hee woulde become Lorde ouer them, and treade them vnder his feete? If GOD had kept ſuch a meane, it ſeemeth that it had beene more profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Iſaack. Wherefore then is it that hee doth multiply him, and that this is the cauſe that hee is purſued, yea, and that he hath no water for himſelf neither for his familie or for his cattel? But God is ſo wiſe in diſpoſing all things, that if hee make his ſeruants to proſper, he ſheweth them that they ought to keepe them ſelues faſt vnto him, and that they haue occaſion to bleſſe him. And yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding: when he layeth them open to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and vexations, hee turneth this alſo to theire good. So then we muſt marke this for a rule, That all the graces which we receiue from the hand of God in this world, they are ioyned with ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeryes, &amp; that our honey is neuer pure, but alwaies there is ſome vineger mixed with it: God coulde well take another courſe, if it had pleaſed him: but we muſt be ſubiect vnto him, and be content with that, that he doth, although that our ſenſes and the luſtes of our fleſh reſiſt againſt it. And true it is that a man which were well aduiſed, would neuer ſeeke to be rich nor wealthy: and ſo that he might haue competent for meat and drinke &amp; clothing: he would ſeeke for no other ſtate or conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Yet notwithſtanding it pleaſeth God to exerciſe one ſort with pouertie, and to be bountifull towardes others: and both poore and rich may be faithful, and bothe twoo the children of God. I ſpeake not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:7669:106" rendition="simple:additions"/> of all in generall: but wee ſee that there are ſome fearing God, who are not all of like eſtate, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: Some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue wealth inough for their maintenaunce, yea &amp; that to make them liue with ſome credite and countenaunce amongſt men: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſome haue ſcarcely a morſel of bread to eate.</p>
               <p>Nowe if it were in vs to order this matter, wee woulde that God ſhould vſe rather an equall and like meaſure: yea, but he knoweth wherefore, he chuſeth rather ſuch a diuerſitie. And therefore (as I haue ſaid) it is for vs to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent our ſelues with his pleaſure. And ſo when it pleaſeth him to make his ſeruants to proſper in ſuch ſorte, that wee may know for a ſuretie that his bleſſing reſteth in their perſons, it is a teſtimonie of his goodneſſe: and heereof they ought to make their profite. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is any ſowrenes mingled with it, they ought to thinke, GOD woulde not that I ſhould ſleepe heere, nor reſt my ſelfe ſo vppon theſe earthly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefites, that they ſhould make mee to forget euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. It behoueth therefore that the faithfull haue this wiſdom and conſideration in them, that alwayes they know how to make their profite, of thoſe benefites that God beſtoweth vpon them: &amp; in the meane time that they forget not the fauour that he hath ſhewed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? although that they haue many cares, griefes, troubles and wronges, which ſhalbe done vnto them by me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And namely here both the rich &amp; poore, are taught their duety. When a man ſhall be afflicted with pouertie and need, yet in the meane time god wil not ſuffer him
<pb facs="tcp:7669:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> to be ſo deſtitute and forſaken, but that alwaies he ſhall haue ſome little portion, too the ende hee may feele that God hath care of him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the faithfull haue not all that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: but God leaueth them there as if he forſooke them: they muſt not therefore murmure againſt him nor think that he hath caſt them off: but how little ſo euer it be, that he hath giuen them (yea be it neuer ſo little) they muſte apply it to taſte the goodneſſe of God, ſo that they may call vpon him as their father, and put their truſt in him, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently beare their condition, which otherwiſe would be hard and miſerable vnto them. And as for the rich, when they ſhall haue more wealth then they haue neede off, if this breede them any care, and bringe ſome griefe as the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is: <hi>He that hath land, hath warre at hand.</hi> If a man haue but an Acre of ground, he ſhall either be drawen into ſute of lawe, or elſe hee ſhall haue ſome other trouble about it. As for the rich (I ſay) when they ſee theſe things, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not poſſeſſe their goods with peace and quietnes, but that they ſhall alwaies haue ſome trouble and diſquietneſſe withall: let them know that for all this, they muſt not be diſtaſted, &amp; that the bleſſing of god always giueth them courage to truſt in him: and that they be not led to vnthankfulnes and forgetfulneſſe: but that alwaies they bleſſe his name. And this is it that wee haue to note out of this place where it is ſaid, that, God made Iſaack to proſper, &amp; that this was the cauſe that moued the inhabitantes of the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7669:107" rendition="simple:additions"/> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie to enuy him, who therfore did driue him out from amongſt them. Now it is ſaid expreſſely
<q>That the king of Gerar ſent vnto him ſaying, wee cannot ſuffer thee to tary amongeſt vs, for thou art mightyer than we.</q> Here we ſee more cleerely that which erſt I tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched: to wit, that they that are not wel roted in the feare of God may do vertuous acts: but this is as it were by blaſts &amp; they doe not continue, ther is no perſeuerance vnles it be in them whom God go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerneth, &amp; whom he hath ſo reformed by his holy ſpirit, that they follow on their courſe til they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e to the goale: yet notwithſtanding eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the faithful them ſelues are not ſo conſtaunt in wel doing, but many times they tread awty &amp; go out of the way: but God correcteth them, &amp; when they are ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here and there, he bringeth them back into the good way. But as for them whom he hath not yet regenerated and borne anewe, &amp; who keepe their naturall inclination, although it ſeeme oftentimes that they wil doe meruels, yet loe in the turning of a hand they are cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged. We ſee this in the king of Gerar, ere while he was as an Angel: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpake of abuſing another mans wife, he ſaid that it was to infect the whole country, and to cauſe the vengeance of God to come vpon great and ſmall. Behold, a diuine ſentence, it ſemeth that God ſpake by his mouth, and indeede there is no doubte but that this confeſſion was wrung from him both againſt himſelfe, &amp; againſt all thoſe, who eſteemed this (as a man ſhould ſay) for a veniall ſinne.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:108"/>
               <p>Beholde then Abimilech who ſheweth that God had euen inforced him &amp; inflamed him with ſuch a zeale, that he had this fault in great deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for he knewe that it was diſpleaſing to God. And therevpon he cauſed his Proclamation to be made, that no man ſhoulde touch Iſaack nor his wife, vpon paine of death. This is yet another commendable poynt: It ſeemeth therefore that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimilech was wholly become fearing GOD: but ſtraight way after he ſaith vnto Iſaack, Away, <hi>get thee hence.</hi> He driueth out Iſaack: hee knoweth that Iſaack is vnder the protection of God: and when hee attempteth any thing againſt him, is it not as it were to diſpite God, and to breake the ſauegarde which hee hath ſet vpon his ſeruaunt?</p>
               <p>Let vs learne therefore, that ſeeing it is ſo, to be ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant amongſt thoſe which haue no feare of God, as that, if they be gentle &amp; curteous for a time vnto vs, &amp; afterwards be changed, that wee beare it with patience, and that wee bee ready too ſuffer iniury of them, after they haue don vs good. Moreouer let vs knowe that vnleſſe God haue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed his feare in vs, and giuen vs a liuely roote of it, we ſhould neuer haue any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtancy or ſtaied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in vs. Let vs pray vnto him that it wold pleaſe him to ſhew vnto vs by effect, that he hath truely renewed vs by his holy ſpirit: &amp; that we haue not a zeale like vnto a fire of ſtubble which quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goeth out: but that wee may deſire alwayes to march on forwards in his obedience and to continue therein: and although that we ſomtimes
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7669:108"/> ſlide from it, as we are very weake, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that wee be not cleane miſſeled and caryed away from him, but that we may followe on our courſe euen vnto the ende. And ſo we haue too beſeech him from day to day, that he will increaſe in vs the graces of his holy ſpirit: for were our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire neuer ſo good, it is certaine that wee ſhoulde be quickly colde: and as our nature is vnconſtant, wee ſhoulde from this day ere too morrowe bee chaunged, were it not that God continued to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs. This is it in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me that we haue to marke. Now the reaſon that is heere brought by Abimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech, is taken from common experience: For wee knowe that rich men deſpiſe the poore, &amp; he that hath muck, thinketh that others are not equall vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: thervpon is hee by and by puffed vp with pride and boldenes, and crueltie followeth: as it is ſaid, Men are like vnto horſes, when they are well fed, they are wanton and vntamed, they kick, they bite: to be ſhort, they will not be ridden. And thus fareth it moſte commonly with men. So then, when a man commeth to be of great ſubſtance &amp; wealth, it is certaine that by nature he wil be bent to aduaunce himſelfe, and pride will beare ſway in him. And ſo is it expreſſely ſaide of Sodom, That when they had great abundaunce of wealth, they became proude, &amp; afterwards followed cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eltie, ſo that they had no pittie vpon their poore neighbours to help them. And this is as it were almoſte an ordinary matter.</p>
               <p>So then, when Abimilech ſayth vnto Iſaack:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:109"/> 
                  <hi>Thou art ſtronger than we: departe therefore and get thee hence.</hi> This is becauſe men doe abuſe the graces of God, and cannot content them ſelues with ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie nor modeſtie, when God doth aduaunce vs.</p>
               <p>Now we knowe heereby, howe peruerſe wee be: for in that God ſheweth him ſelfe liberall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, it is certaine that he draweth neere vnto vs, and draweth vs neere vnto him: &amp; this ſhould giue vs an occaſion to humble our ſelues ſo much the more. For ther is nothing that ought more to bring vs into order, and to doe our duetie, then when God ſheweth him ſelfe on this ſort vnto vs, and that we walke as it were in his ſight. But if wee abuſe his graces, and (as I haue already ſayd) if riches ingender in vs both pride and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and therevpon contempt of thoſe which are our inferiours, and afterwards crueltie, ſo as wee torment one and moleſte an other: wee deuoure this man heeere and that man theere, is not this to turne light into darckneſſe? So then we haue to knowe the peruerſitie which is in vs, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto we are not onely inclined, but alſo giuen, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that God doe withdrawe vs from it. Nowe when God dealeth wel with his children, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he doth correct this vice in them, that they haue no luſt to aduaunce them ſelues, to put out their hornes, and to ſhew foorth their iolities, and to treade vnder their feete thoſe which are not equall vnto them: and we haue already declared, that there is alwayes mingled a certain cooling, to the ende they ſhould not glorye and flatter them
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7669:109"/> ſelues too much in their felicitie. Howſoeuer it bee, it muſt be that he work heerein by his holye ſpirite, for there will neuer be any modeſtie in vs, when ſoeuer any occaſion is offred vnto vs to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce our ſelues: The pille of an Onion (as the common Prouerbe ſayeth) is enough to make vs to forget from whence wee are, and to make vs drunken with arrogancie, and too deſpiſe all other.</p>
               <p>But Iſaack was not ſo giuen too pride and preſumption: and Abimilech doth him wrong. But (as I haue ſayd) hee meaſured it according to the common Elle, becauſe that the faſhion of men is alwayes to oppreſſe the leaſt, when they can doe it, and to take, leaue according to their might to hurte.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is that Abimilech ſayeth: <hi>Thou art more ſtronge then wee.</hi> And hereupon wee haue to note that God admoniſheth vs by this common example, to cary our ſelues peaceably &amp; modeſtly: when wee haue any occaſion offered vs to make any account of our ſelues: that we lay it aſide, &amp; be ſo much the more carefull to keepe our ſelues in our degree, yea in the baſeſt, and in the meane while, if it pleaſe him to bring vs down and to holde vs in a lowe and deſpyſed condition, let vs knowe that he doth it for our good, &amp; that it is as a preſeruatiue medicine: and let vs know, that if wee were aduaunced to any highe place or honor, that it would be to make vs ſtarke blind.
<pb facs="tcp:7669:110"/> And this is it that we haue to beare away in this place. Now it is ſaide afterwardes:
<q>That Iſaack came into the valley of Gerar.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He went not quite out of the countrie: but hee went aparte, to the end not to be any more in their ſight, &amp; to take away all occaſion of malice, from all the inhabitantes of Gerar: for we know what manner of people the Philiſtines were. Heere we ſee in the firſte place the patience of Iſaack: who not onely replyed not: but to purchaſe peace and reſt, truſt vp his baggage &amp; went his way, to pitch his tent elſewhere, and heerein he hath ſhewed his humilitie. It is true that he wente not quite out of the countrie: but yet notwithſtanding hee might haue made ſome reſiſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, for to haue taryed in that place, where he had as it were taken a Farme. We haue ſeene that his father Abraham had as it were prepared a litle armie in his houſe: he might haue therefore doone the like, and ſo might haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the wronge which was doone vnto him. But hee is ſo farre off from this, that hee is as it were a Lambe: and Moyſes ſayeth not, that hee mooued any greate contention, or that hee ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, though he were chaſed from them &amp; that wrongfully, after they had receiued him, and after they had ſhewed him ſome ſigne of curteſie: but hee leaueth all. So then we are taught when wee ſhall be oppreſſed, to beare our wrongs patiently, and not to take the ſwoord in hand, to worke our reuenge, when it ſhall ſeeme that wee haue a iuſte
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7669:110"/> cauſe before men. For wee knowe what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs: to wit, to giue place vnto wrath: that is, to ſuffer that God reuenge for vs, and ſo let vs followe our father Iſaack, in that that hee ſuffred him ſelfe, to be wickedly driuen out of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, where hee had ſo behaued himſelfe, that hee ought rather to haue byn beloued of all. For what occaſion had they giuen them that they ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect any euill in him? And yet notwithſtanding they caſt him out, and ſay that he is too ſtrong, as though hee had abuſed his greatneſſe. So this is one leſſon touching this retraite of Iſaack, where it is ſaide that he came into the valley of Gerar.</p>
               <p>Nowe Moyſes addeth another temptation, which was very hard vnto him: and that was that he had digged the welles that his father Abraham had digged in his life time, and that he kepte the ſame names that was giuen vnto them. Heere wee ſee in the firſt place the malice of the Philiſtins, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Abraham had liued very curteouſly amongſt them: yea and that Abimilech this mans predeceſſor, had made a league with him, &amp; came to ſeeke him, and Abraham in way of homage, had giuen him one of the Welles that he had digged, which he had bought againe, and had preſented the homage vnto him as wee haue ſeene: yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, that they came to damme vp theſe welles. They knew that Abraham was the ſeruant of God &amp; a Prophet: God had maintained his quarrel, and they had a viſible teſtimonie ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for euen the houſe of Abimilech had beene
<pb facs="tcp:7669:111"/> beaten, and GOD hadde ſcourged it: and therefore they might haue beene moued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to haue ſuffered him: and albeit they had not for a time beene well aduiſed, ſeeing that Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham hadde proteſted that hee woulde not doe wronge nor hurte any, as hee had beene ſworne too Abimilech: they ſhoulde haue contented them ſelues heerewith: they hadde knowen the man to be very loyall, and keeping his promiſe where he had made it: notwithſtanding to the end he ſhould neuer returne againe, they dammed vp the Welles which he had digged: for there is no doubt, but this was doone to the ende to ſhut him out from comming any more amongſt them: For as he was a ſtraunger, hee might haue ſoughte out a place fitte for him to dwell in: as if you would ſay, at the leaſte wiſe I ſhall haue Water, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine there is ſome paſture for my Cattel. So then, hee might haue returned backe againe: but what doe they? ô when the water ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from him, hee ſhall be conſtrayned to ſeeke paſture elſe where: hee can neuer returne hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe. See heere a vile &amp; miſcheuous malice: but let vs knowe that it is Gods will, that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould be ſo moleſted, to proue their patience. And againe, let vs note that all falleth out to the confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the wicked, when they are ſo vnkinde againſt the ſeruants of God: For it is certaine that if Abraham had, dwelt there, the bleſſing of God had reſted in that Countrie. And when it is heere
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7669:111"/> rehearſed of Iſaack, that he gathered in an hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth folde ſo much as he ſowed, there is no doubte but that the land was fertile, and that all his neighbors taſted of the fauour of God. To be ſhort, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God alwayes giue ſome ſweete ſauoure of his mercie: and wee haue ſeene that which was ſaid of Sodom and Gomorrhe, that if God could onely haue but founde one ten, the Cittie had not beene ſuncke.</p>
               <p>But ſee the contemners of GOD and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, who driue out the faithful from amongſt them, and cannot abide them: and this ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes turne to their owne confuſion. In the mean while God will haue pittie vpon his owne, and howſoeuer they be thruſt out of the worlde, are perſecuted, and haue not where to ſet their foote, yet will he alwayes finde ſome refuge and ſhadow for them: but yet we muſt bee armed with greate patience, when men are ſo cruell vnto vs, that wee can finde no equitie amongeſt them, that they are as mad beaſtes: yet muſt wee endure all this, that we may be armed with the ſpirit of God, which is the ſpirite of lenitie. For certaine it is that wee neede nothing to make vs to caſte out our poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: For we are ſo delicate &amp; nice, that we can ſuffer nothing, and we are alwaies ready to reuenge our owne quarrels. Wee ſhall therefore neuer bee ſo gentle, to beare the wronges that are doone vnto vs, vnleſſe that GOD gouerne vs by his holy Spirite: but howſoeuer it bee, the example
<pb facs="tcp:7669:112"/> of the fathers is heere ſet before vs, to the ende we ſhould learne, not to vexe and diſquiet our ſelues too much, when men torment vs in any maner of ſorte whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is ſaid heere expreſſely, that <hi>Iſaack kept the names of the Welles,</hi> as we haue ſeene of Berſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba, which was the Well of the othe, in aſmuch as Abimilech had there ſworne with Abraham. Nowe this was to maintaine poſſeſſion: For this was aſmuch as a publique inſtrumente or Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or rather more. Abimilech had made a league there with Abraham: Loe, a promiſe made with a ſolemne ceremonie, Abraham had acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged homage vnto him for the Welles: the name teſtifieth the ſame. So that Iſaack pretendeth that the inhabitants knew, that this was a parcel of the inheritaunce which his father had purchaſed, for him, and therfore that it was his owne by law. But all this preuaileth nothing, what iuſt title ſo euer he had, yet notwithſtanding they ceaſſe not too quarrel againſt him. Thus we ſee, howſoeuer the children of God ſeeke nothing elſe, but to inioy that which is their owne, and which it is lawful for them to vſe: notwithſtandinge they ſhall bee thruſt from it. For the contemners of God are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent: and what ſoeuer men alleadge vnto them, yet neither reaſon nor equitie can preuaile with them, and be made account off. When we ſhall ſee the like at this day, let vs not think it a newe and a ſtraunge thing. There was more ſimplicitie in that time then, and yet neuertheleſſe we ſee that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7669:112"/> Iſaack muſt be thruſt from all that which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as iuſtly to be his, as was poſſible.</p>
               <p>Nowe therevpon it is ſayd, that he gaue names to theſe two Welles which were take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from him, that is to ſay, for which he was drawen into law: that is to ſay, from which he was put: For it boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him not too pleade, as at this day: but by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence hee is driuen out of poſſeſſion. Nowe there is no doubt when hee gaue theſe names of ſtrife and brable, or contention, but that this was doone, as if he made his complaint to God, when he ſaw that mens eares were deafe, and all reaſons excluded: he hath no other way, but this to ſet vp a memorial, to the end God might haue pittie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Now therfore let vs learne, when we can gaine nothing by bringing foorth our titles and right to keepe that which is ours, &amp; that which is giuen vs: that yet notwithſtanding wee leaue not off to truſt that in the ende God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will haue pittie vpon vs. Loe then what wee haue to doe: That is, that aſmuch as lyeth in vs, wee indeuour that men may leaue vs in peace, and that they come not to deuoure vs. This ſhall alwayes be lawfull to the children of God: For howſoeuer wee bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be as ſheeepe amongſt Wolues, yet hath God permitted vnto vs a peaceable defence, inaſmuch as he hath taken vs into his hands.</p>
               <p>We muſt indeuour therfore, aſmuch as lyeth in vs, to repell all violences, wrongs, outrages and ryots, that ſhalbe done vnto vs, &amp; all moleſtations that can be deuiſed againſt vs. Haue we done this?
<pb facs="tcp:7669:113"/> If we gaine nothing, and that men be ſo obſtinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bent to miſchief, and ſpecially if they be poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſuch furie, that all reaſon be troden vnder foote amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs haue recourſe vnto God, and pray him that it wil pleaſe him too take oure cauſe into his owne hands: and doubte wee not, when men ſhal become ſo vncurteous, that they ſhal deride at whatſoeuer we can alledge, that in the ende God wil take order with them. Lo then what we haue to beare away of the example of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack, when he named the welles. Strife, debate &amp; contention. For this was not of Choler, or of the Splene: as there are very many which wil reuenge themſelues, and caſt out ſome iniurious word: but Iſaack commended his cauſe too God: as alſo wee are exhorted by Saincte Peter, that if wee bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uied of men &amp; can find no remedie at their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that then we wait whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God will put to his hand, as ſurely he wil.</p>
               <p>Nowe in the ende it is ſaide, that Iſaack ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing digged a Well for which hee was not aſſailed, that hee named it <hi>Reb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Loe a <hi>Largeſſe</hi> but he ſaith, beholde the <hi>Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes</hi> which God hath beſtowed vpon vs. Wee yet ſee more plainely that which I haue touched before: That is, when Iſaack was in ſo greate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe that hee had no water to drinke, that men were ſo cruell vnto him that hee could not drinke of the water which he had digged by his owne la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7669:113"/> and by the handes of his familie, that hee remitteth this matter to GOD, who is the iuſte Iudge.</p>
               <p>But contrarywiſe, when God had compaſſion vppon him, and that men came no more to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, and that hee had water to drinke for him ſelfe, and for all his company: Oh well ſaith hee. This is God that hath beſtowed this vpon me. He ſayth not ô: in the end yet I haue obtained my purpoſe, Theſe wicked ones haue let me alone at the length: nowe let vs take our eaſe? Hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not ſo ſimply, as a prophane man would haue doone, but he would haue a memoryall of thanks giuing vnto God, as he had ſet vp memorialls of his complaint to drawe the Lord to haue mercy vpon him.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe his minde is, now that this benefite of God ſhould bee as it were ingrauen there, and that men ſhould ſpeake of it, not onely for three dayes, but after his death: and that they ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that Well a ſigne of the fauour that God had ſhewed him. And let vs note this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance: For hee ceaſeth not to giue GOD thankes with a quiet hearte, though hee hadde beene a longe time afflicted. When wee haue endured long the like troubles, the graces of God are wont to bee darkened by that feeling of our euill: and if GOD ſuffer vs to languiſhe for a time, although afterwards hee reach out his hand vnto vs, yet we thinke it is not from him: but we attribute this to fortune.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:114"/>
               <p>But Iſaack did not ſo: but although he was driuen out, and that he had indured this for a long time, yet ſo ſoone as God had giuen him releaſe, he ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſeth his name, and ſayth, God hath inlarged me. Loe (ſayth he) the <hi>largeſſes</hi> or <hi>bounties</hi> of GOD. which I beholde in this Well. But nowe in the ende we haue to note the patience of Iſaack, when we preach now a dayes of patience, hardly can we get this poynt, that if wee haue to indure neuer ſo little, we be not by and by hot &amp; angry: and when it ſeemeth that we are very patient, yet there wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be ſome grudging, vnleſſe God euen at the firſt puſh comfort vs: &amp; in the meane ſeaſon, what ſuffer we? Surely in a manner nothing. If we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but a fillip, ô, it is ſo hard as nothing can bee harder: and moreouer if men goe on to doe vs wrong, ô, we ſuffer too much. But we are farre of from this lenitie and ſoftneſſe, which is here ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vs in our father Iſaack. Wee wil ſay I cannot beare it. If any man wronge vs, but the value of three halfpence, or of ſome ſmall portion of our good: ô I can not indure it: this is too much. Yea but Iſaack ſtriued for water (I ſay ſtriued,) hee tooke not a ſword to fight: but he ſuffred wrong: although he had digged the welles, and his father had purchaſed them with his owne proper good, and that the Kinge had made him a graunte, and that he had digged them againe, and taken a greate deale of trauell to haue water to drinke, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, we ſee his patience. And ſo when God ſhall afflict vs, and ſhal looſe the bridle to the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:7669:114"/> wicked, that wee ſhalbe pilled &amp; polled of them, let vs yet knowe that we are not come to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, not to haue a drop of water, and to haue thoſe elements taken from vs, which God would haue common amongſt men. For euery man will haue his portion aparte, bothe of corne, and of wine, of fleſh, and ſuch like thinges, and of moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and poſſeſſions: euery one will haue his owne: but as for water, it is an Element which GOD hath ordayned for all men.</p>
               <p>When there are Riuers, Welles and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines in any high way: why ſhoulde they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from thoſe that are the creatures of God? But howſoeuer it bee, yet it fell out that our fathers were brought to ſuch extremitie. And this (as I haue already touched) ſerueth to this purpoſe that wee ſhould learne to be patient, not onely to ſuffer ſome one little iniurie, or twoo or three: but that in all reſpectes we ſhoulde bee ſo meeke and ſofte natured: that if it were in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life and death (as they ſay) we put our hope in God, that he wil ſhew himſelf pitiful towards vs. And therefore let vs not double our euil, let vs not make of one deuil two, when the wicked and vngodly perſecute vs vniuſtly: but let vs labour to ſoften their heartes, and to aſſwage the malice which they vſe againſt vs. If we doe ſo, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that howſoeuer we be for a time in extreme anguiſh, yet in the ende God will ſo inlarge vs, that wee ſhall haue good cauſe to bleſſe his holye name with full mouth.</p>

               <p>their dwelling, they muſt bee flitting and haue no reſting place, vnleſſe they bee lodged from day to day (as it were) by the hand of GOD, and in the meane ſeaſon, that they prepare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der &amp; go from place to place, after the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of their fathers, who learned by experience not too haue their inheritance here beneath vpon earth, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed them ſelues to be Pilgrimes, as we ſhall ſee heereafter that Iacob anſweared Pharao. In the meane time we may ſee alſo the malice of all thoſe neere neighbours thereaboutes: For the Welles eſpecially, which Abraham had bought, were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him after his death, to the ende that his ſucceſſours and Children might haue no vſe of them. But it is ſaid that Iſaack yet digged a Well there: for he could not be without water, both for the familie he had, which was greate, as for his Cattel: but he wente very farre to ſeeke water, vntill GOD reſtored him too that which was wrongfully taken from him. He dwelleth ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Beer-ſcheba</hi> for a time without water, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee borrowe or buye it: but afterwardes hee findeth his Well againe, and ſo is at ſome better eaſe then before, and God ſuffereth them not that would as it were haue made them to dye of thirſt to vſe their malice and to come to their purpoſe. But howſoeuer it be, God hearde him not at the firſt daſhe Wee haue then to learne heere, that which was touched yeſterday: that is, that wee learne to endure need, yea in the need of water, &amp; that we thinke it not ſtraunge which our fathers
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:7669:115"/> haue tryed. For it is no reaſon that wee ſhould bee more priuiledged then they. And if God ſpare vs, that we acknowledge his goodnes in this point: and if he afflict vs in any other ſort, that wee be ſo much the more framed to patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. But yet it is ſaid:
<q>That God appeared vnto him, the very firſte night that he went to Beerſeba.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Heere we muſt note that which wee haue han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled before in the life of Abraham: that is, that God appeared vnto him, foraſmuch as hee had need to be ayded &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forted, by reaſon of his great heauineſſes and troubles, which he had ſuffred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. This circumſtance then is woorthy to bee noted: and that is, that God ſeeing his ſeruaunt to bee afflicted euen to extremitie, he would giue him ſome eaſe: as at this day, although we haue no ſuch viſions, GOD neuertheleſſe ceaſeth not to ſhewe himſelf vnto vs, when he ſeeth that we can beare no more, and that wee were like to faile vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he reach foorth his helping hand to ſuſtaine vs. Howe ofte ſoeuer we are in diſtreſſe, we think that God hath eſtranged him ſelfe from vs, and we imagine that hee hath vtterly forgotten vs. But contrarywiſe, when hee maketh vs to taſte his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, in what ſorte ſoeuer it be, or rather that hee doth ſtrengthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, &amp; that we fight valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly againſt all temptatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, or rather that he deliuereth vs from the wrongs and vexations that are doone vnto vs, or that he doth aſſiſt vs as it were, after ſome viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner: then loe his preſence, and then wee
<pb facs="tcp:7669:116"/> ſee that hee hath care ouer vs. So let vs note, that when God appeared to Iſaack, that it muſt needes be that he had beene in ſome great neceſſitie: For this happened not euery day: and therevpon let vs learne to holde our ſelues contented, when God after that hee hath ſuffred vs too bee tormented, too bee diſquieted, troubled, and moleſted, that in the ende he ſheweth him ſelfe to be father vnto vs. And if this fall not out ſo ſoone, let vs wayt vpon him, as wee ſee Iſaack did, who had not alwayes a certaine ſigne that GOD would aſſiſte him: but contrarywiſe hee then ſeeth him ſelfe quite deſtitute of all ſuccour, and that for a longe time: and after one miſerie was come, behold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other followeth as thick as might bee: and yet notwithſtanding hee quailed not: And therfore let vs follow that path. And in the meane ſeaſon let vs marke alſo that one onely worde which God ſhall ſpeake vnto vs, to witneſſe the loue which hee beareth vnto vs, will be better worth vnto vs, then all the goods which we can haue, yea if we had to eate and drinke our fill, and that in all delicacie, though there were no man to trouble vs, though wee reſt on euery ſide: To bee ſhorte, though we had all at our heartes deſire: If the worlde went thus with vs, it is certaine that we oughte not to eſteeme ſo muche of it, as to haue this teſtimonie, that GOD is mercifull vnto vs. For let vs put the caſe, that a man did ſwimme in all pleaſures and hadde all the eaſe in the worlde and wanted nothing: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:7669:116"/> if hee knowe not, howe it ſtandeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt GOD and him, if he haue no doctrine, no promiſe, hee ſhall bee alwayes as it were in doubte whether his eaſe will laſte or no: and if he become ſo drunken therewith, that hee thinke that his proſperttie ſhall yet continue with him, what maye it be too haue after this ſorte all his felicitie in this worlde? How long indures this life?</p>
               <p>So then all the bleſſinges that may happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, are nothing, neither can they haue any good ſauour, vnleſſe wee be aſſured of the fauour of GOD: but on the other ſide, when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to declare vnto vs that he loueth vs, and that we are in his protection, that wee can not periſh, that he holdeth vs by the hand, and that we are kepte and garded by him. This is it then that ought to content vs, though al the reſt did faile vs. So then, how ſoeuer God gaue ſome ſigne vnto Iſaack, that he had looked vpon him in pittie: this was nothing in compariſon of that which Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes rehearſeth now, which was <hi>that God appeared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,</hi> to the ende to continue his couenaunt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes him, and too ratifie it ſo much the more, and that he was altogither reſolued therin, in ſuch ſorte that he was a Buckler vnto him, to breake all temptations. But we haue here in the firſt place to note, that this was a viſion to prepare Iſaack, to the end that the word which muſt be giuen vnto him, might bee receiued with the greater reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and authoritie.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:117"/>
               <p>Now this viſion was as a ſigne that God ſpake: and this hath alwayes byn very neceſſary: For we knowe howe the deuil laboureth to ſeduce vs by illuſions and vaine fantaſies. When therefore the fathers were taught, to the end they might haue a ful aſſuraunce of their faith, the maieſtie of God manifeſted it ſelfe vnto them, whereof they had ſome infallible impreſſion: For if the worde one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had come vnto them, it had beene as a ſounde in the ayre without al ſtedineſſe. This therefore is no ſuperfluous thing, when Moiſes ſaith, that God ſhewed and declared him ſelfe vnto Iſaack: For it was neceſſary that Iſaack ſhould knowe and bee thorowly perſwaded, that the worde which hee heard, proceeded from heauen, and that he might reſte therein, that it was an vndoubted trueth, in which he could not be abuſed. It is true that God is inuiſible, and cannot be comprehended: and ſo farre is it off, that we can comprehende him with the eye, that if we doe apply all our ſenſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is certaine that we ſhall neuer attaine too his high maieſtie: The Eſſence of God therefore, in that it is infinite, can not bee ſeene of men, but this letteth not but that hee may ſhewe him ſelfe ſo farre foorth as is expedient for vs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſmall meaſure that is in vs. Thus as often as wee reade that God appeared vnto the ancient Fathers, this ſheweth not that they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended al his eſſence &amp; maieſtie: For that had bin a thing impoſſible: Mans ſpirit is very rude: but he ſo ſhewed him ſelfe, as they were able too beare:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7669:117"/> that is to ſay, ſo farre forth as he ſawe it to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for them. Yea and if God ſhould lay open his glorie vnto vs, it would by &amp; by ouerwhelme vs: I ſay if wee had a great deale more vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding than we haue, and that our ſpirit could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehende an hundred times more then it doth: yet ſhould wee be ſo aſtoniſhed at the glorie of God, that we ſhould therin be altogether confounded. It behoueth therefore that God haue regard what we are able to beare, when it pleaſeth him too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare vnto vs. And ſo let vs mark, howe the word which Moyſes vſeth here is too bee taken, that is, that Iſaack, to the end that he might be more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of the promiſe which was made vnto him, &amp; that he might holde it as an autenticall promiſe, &amp; in no wiſe doubt but that it was god that had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto him, he had ſome ſigne and marke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he felt that he could not bee deceyued, that it was no fanſie or ſome light imagination: but that God would giue him a ſure holde to leane vppon, that he would giue him ſuch a reſt, as he might by the vertue of the worde, which ſhall afterwardes be added, fight againſt whatſoeuer euil might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto him. Nowe it is ſaide, that God exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, that he ſhould not feare, and hee giueth him a reaſon why:
<q>I am (ſaith hee) with thee, yea I, the God of Abraham thy father.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When he ſayth, <hi>Feare not:</hi> we haue expounded this already before, that God meaneth not too
<pb facs="tcp:7669:118"/> exempte thoſe too whome hee ſpeaketh, from all feare: For howſoeuer the fathers were Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours againſt all the defiaunces, which coulde bee made agaynſt them, yet were they not inſenſible. Abraham was tempted: but hee was not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Therefore we muſt remember this point, that they that became Conquerours thorough the power of the ſpirite of GOD, fought not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding.</p>
               <p>Nowe what ſtrife or combate can there bee, vnleſſe there bee ſome feeling of it? For if Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had not felt this in him ſelfe, See I am in daunger, hee would neuer haue called vppon GOD, and hee would neuer haue had recourſe vnto him: if hee had not bene preſſed with the griefes which hee endured, hee would not haue made his requeſts and complaints vnto God, to be eaſed &amp; lightened of them. So then we may not think, that God would haue them to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all feeling too whom hee hath ſayde, Feare not: but it was, too holde them ſo faſte vnto him ſelfe, that they ſhould not bee vnmeaſurably a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frayde as wee vſe too bee, vnleſſe wee haue our reſt vppon God: For the leaſt blaſt of winde in the world is inough to ſhake vs, and to make vs ſo at our wits ende, that we can not tell which waye to turn vs: as it is ſaid of Achas, that he was afraid, and ſhooke as a leafe of a tree: and Eſay to remedy this euil, ſaith: <hi>Huſht, holde thy peace before God.</hi> And this is the common ſtyle of the holy ſcripture. So then marke what this worde importeth, where it
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:7669:118"/> is ſaid, <hi>Feare not:</hi> that is to ſay, howſoeuer we haue occaſion to feare, &amp; to be aſtoniſhed, yet let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and waite with patience til god ſhal ſuccor vs: &amp; let not this feare oppreſſe vs, &amp; quite ſtifle vs: but let vs indeuour to recouer our ſelues &amp; keepe the right path. And albeit we be diſquieted and toſſed hither &amp; thither, let vs alwayes remaine faſt vpon our feet, ſeeing we are grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promiſe of God. But it is ſayd expreſſely: <hi>I am with thee:</hi> to ſhew that when we haue God on our ſide, this ought to ſuffiſe vs, though all the world miſchieuouſly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe our ruine, that looke how many men, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enimies there are: yea &amp; that it ſeemeth that all creatures haue conſpired againſt vs, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſo that God take our part, it ſhal make vs too ouercome al feare. And in deed wee ſee howe the Prophet Dauid did practiſe this doctrine, and Sainct Paule alſo giueth vs example thereof:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 3.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing God</hi> (ſaieth hee) <hi>is for mee, I will not feare though I were compaſſed about with an hundred thouſande men:</hi> when I ſhall ſee all the deathes in the worlde, I will aſſure my ſelfe vppon Gods ſhepheardes crooke. Loe howe hee ſpeaketh in the three and twentie Pſalme, O Lord thy hooke, that is to ſay, the ſtaffe which thou erecteſt, as a ſhephearde, (For hee taketh a ſimilitude from the ſhepheard, who will haue his ſtaffe or his hooke too leade his ſheepe:) Lord (ſaith hee) ſoe that I may haue ſome ſigne too aſſure mee, that thou accompteſt mee one of thy flocke, I will walke in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe of death, and yet I will comfort my ſelfe:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:119"/> For I will accompte my ſelfe ynough comforted, ſo that I may be grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon thy grace. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in another place, <hi>ſeeing that God is with mee:</hi> I defie all thoſe which ſhall come too aſſaile mee. What is that that fleſhe ſhall do vntoo me, ſo that God take my part (ſayeth he?) He ſcorneth there the weakneſſe of men, ſhewing that God blowing vpon them, he can ouerthrowe them all, and bring them to nothing: and notwithſtanding if hee bee armed with ſtrength from aboue, all the threates which the Deuil ſhalbe able to bende againſt him, ſhalbe nothing. And this is it that Saint Paule tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs: <hi>If God be with vs, who ſhalbe againſt vs?</hi> Not that we ſhall not haue many things againſt vs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that God bee the keeper of our life: but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding wee may boaſte our ſelues agaynſt all our enemies, and againſt all that the Deuil ſhal deuiſe againſt vs, ſo that God be fauourable vntoo vs. So, that it is not without cauſe that this worde is couched in, to take away al feare, when he ſaith: <hi>I am with thee, Feare not therefore.</hi> Now altogether like as we are taught to reſt our ſelues vppon the onely goodneſſe of God, and in his fatherly fauour: ſo contrariwiſe we haue to marke, that without it, we are alwayes as a people that are euen ſowning And this alſo is that we haue touched erewhile: to witte, that if God doo not teſtifie vnto vs the loue that he beareth vs, though we ſhuld be in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paradiſe, we ſhould bee in a hell: and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, though we vvere in ſome hell, that is to ſay, in ſome gulffe, ſo that we feele that God is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:7669:119"/> vnto vs, and that in the ende hee wil take pitie vpon vs, and that wee bee aſſured of his ayde, an hell will alwayes fall out too bee a paradiſe. And this is the thing we haue to obſerue in this place: That when a man knoweth not howe it ſtandeth with him in reſpect of God, that is to ſay, hee can not aſſure him ſelfe, that God beareth a fatherly affection vnto him: he muſt needes tremble, and be alwayes ſhaken on euery ſide, and haue manie prickes to vexe and torment him, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any cauſe why: and that very ofte, he ſhalbe in great perplexitie. Loe then in what caſe the vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers are: not that they are not bolde ynough, yea euen to deſpite God: For it ſeemeth too them that they are eſcaped his hand, &amp; that if he ſhould thunder from heauen, that he can not touch them. The wicked then and thoſe that are contemners of God will in deede be ſo far bold in their pride: but notwithſtanding God giueth them prickes within, ſo that they haue, as a man woulde ſay, blinde aſſaults, that they know not from whence they come: and neuertheleſſe it is God that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth warre againſt them with their owne vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe. And this is the reward of all thoſe, that reſt not only in God, and knowe not that all our ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, all our ioye and felicitie is to be in his keping. All they therefore that preſume of their ovvne ſtrength and vertues, all they that ſo occupie their mindes in theſe earthly creatures, they muſt in the ende be payde home with their owne fooliſh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, bicauſe they haue not giuen vnto God
<pb facs="tcp:7669:120"/> that honor that belongeth vnto him: that is, they muſt find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues as poore ſowning people. And therfore let vs learne, albeit that God giue vs our deſires and all the pleaſures that are poſſible to bee wiſhed for, that we doo not in ſuch ſorte reſte vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them, that we turne away from him: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs learne too keepe our ſelues in that fauor and teſtimonie that we haue, that in that hee hath adopted vs for his children, he will alwayes ſhew him ſelfe a father towardes vs. When then wee ſhall bee thus thorowly perſwaded, it is certaine that wee ſhall ouercome all feares: but contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, when we ſhall imagine too be aſſured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the protection of God, it muſt needes be that hee ſhewe vs what our follie and ouerweening is. And this brieflie is that wee haue too beare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye in this place. And ſo let vs ioyne theſe two thinges togyther as inſeparable and not to be ſundred: That GOD is with vs, and that wee are well aſſured agaynſt all euill: For if hee bee farre from vs, Alas, we are more then miſerable, albeit we were in a paradiſe, as I haue ſayde alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die: but when hee is with vs, though wee walke in the ſhadowe and darkneſſe of death, and that it ſeemes wee muſt periſhe euery minute of an howre, yet vve leaue not of too comfort oure ſelues, knowing vvell that death ſhall be turned to vs into lyfe, &amp; that al ſhall fall out to our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Againe, vvee haue too note this, that hee ſayeth, <hi>That hee is the God of Abraham:</hi> For by this vvoord hee calleth too Iſaacks remembrance all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:7669:120"/> the which hee had learned of his father. If hee had not bene inſtructed, and that Abraham had not done his dutie too ſaye vnto him: My Sonne, GOD hath giuen mee this priuiledge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all men, that hee hath declared vnto mee and ſayde vnto me, that my ſtocke ſhall be as his heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and that hee will bleſſe vs, and we ſhal be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated and ſanctified from all the reſt of the world: but yet marke howe it behooueth vs too woorſhip him, marke howe wee muſt call vppon him, See howe wee muſt ſerue him. If therefore Abraham had not faythfully taught his ſonne Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack: this woorde ſhould haue bene of no force: <hi>I am the God of Abraham,</hi> and in deed it had impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing but ſuperſtition. And ſo, let vs marke well that by this word, God would giue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Iſaack of that whiche he had learned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his father. The Papiſtes make a buckler of this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wil keepe themſelues to their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes &amp; errors: For they haue that from other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers &amp; anceſtors which they followe, they haue not inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it at this day: it ſeemeth therfore vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that this is ynough to beate backe, yea euen whatſoeuer god himſelf hath ſhewed by his word ſo that they follow their fathers &amp; elders. Well, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god is named the God of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed this one thing, to wit, that Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a faith ruled by the doctrine, which had bin taught him. And wherefore is it that he nameth not him ſelf, the god of Nachor? And why is it that hee calleth not him ſelfe the God of Thare?
<pb facs="tcp:7669:121"/> For this had bene ſomewhat more. The Papiſtes will not ſay, It is an hundred yeeres ſince that that which we call the ſeruice of God amongſt vs, was vſed amongeſt men: but they will ſaye: What? There is a thouſande yeeres, ſince the worlde was ſo gouerned. Loe then them ſelues in poſſeſſion to deſpite God, as ſeemeth vnto them, when they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a thouſand yeares.</p>
               <p>Nowe then if the queſtion were ſimply of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie, he muſt haue ſaid, I am thy god of Thare and of Nachor, or rather hee muſt haue gone fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntill he had come to thoſe that went before. But there is no queſtion of ſpeaking in that ſorte. God had called Abraham, and Abraham was dead of late, the others had bin a great deale more auncient: what diſtinction ſhall wee make heere? wee muſte not forge it according too our owne braine: but we muſt looke vnto that marke, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto God would direct Iſaack: There is no doubt but this was, bicauſe Abraham (as we haue ſayde alreadie,) had a full certaintie of faith, that he had not an opinion onely as had the reſt of the world, to ſaye, I imagine ſo, I thinke ſo, but he was fully certified that God had ſpoken vnto him. Lo then in what reſpect and for what cauſe it is now ſaid, <hi>I am the God of Abraham, thy father.</hi> And ſo, let vs wel marke what fathers we ought to follow, that we be not deceiued therin. For if our fathers had byn duely taught, and that they had bene framed vnto the trueth of God, it had nowe bene a good helpe vnto our faith: For when vvee haue guides too
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:7669:121"/> ſhewe vs the way, this is much to our aduantage, and we ought not to deſpiſe it: but if wee haue had fathers who were not the children of God, (wherevppon all paternitie and parentage depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, as Saint Paule ſayeth) then muſt wee ſhut our eyes. For when God hath not his ſoueraigne degree of being the father, and euery thing be not referred to him, then woe vpon al parentages and bondes which we ſhal haue in this world: for they are ſo many nettes of Sathan. So, let vs marke wel that as it is ſaid in this place, that God is the God of Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Iſaacks father: ſo it is ſaide on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie by the Prophet Ezechiel: <hi>Walke not in the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſnes of your fathers.</hi> And why ſo? Theſe fathers followed not Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſteppes, but departed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from: and therefore they were no longer worthy of ſo honourable a title of fathers, foraſmuch as they were not (at a very woord) the children of God. And ſo let vs feare, leaſt that be ſpoken vnto vs (that S. Stephen hath ſpoken,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51.</note>) <hi>Ye vncircumciſed of heart, ye haue alwayes reſiſted God and his holy ſpirit, as did your fathers alſo.</hi> But if there were any ignorance or rebellion in our fathers, let vs forſake it, to the end wholly to reſigne vp our ſelues too our heauenly father: and notwithſtanding, whereas the Papiſts crie, <hi>The fathers, fathers,</hi> let vs learne to diſcerne, and let vs not bee beaſtes as they are, too take oure fathers from ſome ſtewes:<note place="margin">Spitle houſe.</note> as they take all thoſe for their fathers, who haue peruerted and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the ſimplicitie both of the Lawe and the Goſpell: too witte, theſe Dottards and rabble of
<pb facs="tcp:7669:122"/> Friars and Monkes, who haue beene the falſifiers of the holy Scripture. To the ende therfore we be not in ſuch wiſe bereued and ſpoyled of our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, let vs know that our fathers muſt be the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, of whome dependeth all parentage, as wee haue alleadged out of S. Paule. Loe then ſhortly what we haue to learne out of this place: that is to ſay, that Iſaack was admoniſhed, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and call to his remembrance, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer hee had learned before, and that this was for too confirme his faith, when GOD ſayde, that hee had manifeſted him ſelfe vnto his father Abraham. And nowe at this daye wee haue too put this doctrine in practiſe, as often as wee ſhall haue neede too aſſure our ſelues, or rather when our ſpirit is troubled, and wee toſſed with ſome wauering and vncertaintie, wee muſt haue oure recourſe thither: That is too followe our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abraham, to conforme our ſelues too fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that rule, which hee hath ſhewed vnto vs. And why ſo? For wee are certaine, that GOD was manifeſted vnto him. Loe then a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and which ſhall not turne vs out of the path of our ſaluation: when wee ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and faſhioned too our father Abraham, who was adopted of GOD, and who receyued the pledge of our ſaluation: that is too ſaye, all theſe promiſes wherevppon wee ought at this daye to be grounded. And ſuch accompt ought wee too make of all the reſt of the faithfull. For although they no whit appertayne vnto vs,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:7669:122"/> concerning the fleſhe, yet notwithſtanding wee ceaſſe not too bee their children. And therefore it is not without cauſe that the Apoſtle in the eleuenth Chapter too the Hebrues ſetteth before vs, this thicke cloude of witneſſes, when as hee would ſhewe vs, that wee are very vnkinde, if we followe not thoſe, whome GOD hath ſet forth vnto vs for an example. <hi>Loe</hi> (ſayeth hee) <hi>a great and thicke cloude of witneſſes who calles vs too GOD,</hi> that would ſeeme, (as if a man would ſaye) too ſtoppe vp our eyes. We will be offended with a man, when hee ſhall ſeduce vs, wee will imagine too bee excuſed by ſaying, O, hee did therein aſmuch as I: wee neede no more but a ſmall flie too make vs too turne awaye from the feare of God and his obedience: and notwithſtanding that GOD ſhall ſet before vs ſo many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, too prooue our fayth, that wee ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bee ſatisfied, yet wee come not to him. And if this profite vs nothing, and wee bee not confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med thereby, what is the cauſe thereof, but oure owne vnthankfulnes? And ſo then, ſo often as our faith ſhalbe weake, that wee ſhall haue ouerthwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as it were ſtormes, let vs think, And what? hath God begun but yeſterday and to day to ſpeake? Spake he not vnto Abraham? And was not his truth certaine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time forwarde? and beſides al the faithful which came afterwards, al the holy kings &amp; prophets, and others, are they not ſo many witneſſes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God ſhewed vnto vs? Let vs therefore ioyne them too this holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
<pb facs="tcp:7669:123"/> nowe. For howe often ſoeuer the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell hath bene preached vnto vs (according as the Apoſtle hath entreated thereof) it is not onely too gather vs togither with al the faythful, which are liuing at this daye, but alſo into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and companie of all the holy ſpirites, whom GOD hath taken out of this worlde. We are therefore at this daye ioyned in fellowſhip with all the holy Patriarkes and Prophetes, as often as GOD ſpeaketh vnto vs. But wee ſhall be ſo much the more without excuſe, bycauſe we know not howe too make our profite of all this: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that GOD hath yet reuealed it more cleerely vnto vs, and in a more familiar ſorte in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone of his onely begotten Sonne. For hee is not onely named at this day the GOD of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, but alſo the father of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſte. In aſmuch therefore as wee haue the full and perfecte reuelation of whatſoeuer is profitable vnto vs for our ſaluation in this liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly image in whome GOD is ſet foorth: it is certayne that wee haue no colour, that wee can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, why wee ſhoulde not haue ſuch a certaintie of faith, that wee ſhould neuer ſtraye hither and thither: and when the worlde chaungeth it ſelfe an hundred thouſande tymes, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, that we ſhould remayne ſtedfaſt in that wee haue receyued of God, knowing that his trueth is vnchaungeable. This therefore ſhortly is that whiche wee haue too beare awaye concerning this texte.</p>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:7669:123"/>
               <p>And further, let vs likewiſe note that woorde of the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, when he ſaith: <hi>I goe too my God and to your God, to my Father and to your Father.</hi> See the Sonne of God, who is the euerlaſting God, neuertheleſſe to the end to gather vs vnto himſelf, &amp; to keepe vs ſure there, in ſuch ſorte that we ſhuld neuer be ſeduced from that foundation which hee hath giuen vnto vs of his trueth, he ſayth, that we haue one God togither with him, inaſmuch as hee is man, and in that he is our brother: that we haue the ſame God who is his God, and the ſame father who is his father. When we heare theſe things, is there any farther cauſe for vs to doubt, or to be ſhaken? As there are many who will ſaye at this day: O, I knowe not what to holde: there are ſo many ſundrie opinions, that I am confounded: &amp; likewiſe I can beleeue nothing, I know not what to followe. But it can not be choſen, but that ſuch people are poſſeſſed of the Deuil, when they tread vnder their feete the trueth of God, which is as a moſt vndoubted light to guide vs, and to ſhewe vs the way of ſaluation. So then, ſeeing God hath ſhewed him ſelfe ſince Abraham and Noah, and appointed Moyſes too bee the conductour of his Church, and that he hath knit vs altogither, when in the ende he ſent his onely begotten Sonne, in whoſe perſone he hath gathered vs all to him ſelf: let vs learn to kepe our ſelues in that vnitie of faith which he hath giuen vs, and let vs not doubt, but that he wil alwaies auow vs for his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Now we haue to note that which God ſaith, <hi>That he wil
<pb facs="tcp:7669:124"/> bleſſe Iſaac and wil multiplie his ſeede:</hi> For this ſerueth to ſhewe that the fauour which god beareth to thoſe whom he hath called to himſelfe, is not vaine nor idle: but that it bringeth forth his fruite and effect in time. It is therefore very certaine, that when God ſhalbe mercifull vnto vs, hee will giue vs ſo many good things, as he knoweth to be good for vs: it is true that this ſhall not be according to our deſire, but howſoeuer it be, proſperitie ſhal always be coupled with the fauour &amp; loue of God. Now we knowe that he hath all in his hand, &amp; he is no nigard, that he will not giue to his children what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer he knoweth to be meete for them. Let vs learne therfore to wayte for al proſperitie, &amp; free fauour of our God, when it ſhall pleaſe him to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie vnto vs that he loueth vs, and that he is with vs (as I haue ſaid already:) and in the meane while notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, although that we haue many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſities, which trouble &amp; moleſt vs, and that they be hard &amp; bitter vnto vs, yet let vs neuer giue ouer to hold vs faſt vnto his promiſe. And when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue any grace fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hand of God, let vs applie the ſame alwaies, to ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthen our faith, &amp; to haue this vndoubted perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that we ſhal trie that to be true which is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> here: <hi>I wilbe with thee, and I wil bleſſe thee.</hi> And certaine it is, that if we would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wel the benefits of God, that we daily receiue from him, and that they were valued of vs as they ought, we ſhould haue alwaies good cauſe to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor him &amp; to reioice ourſelues in him: but alacke we deuoure vp the benefits that he beſtoweth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:7669:124"/> vs: &amp; in the meane while we mowe at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; neuer think vpon them. And we may ſee, that this is the cauſe that we are ſo giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to murmure, to fret &amp; to diſcontent ourſelues. And why ſo? For the benefits of God, ought to ſuffiſe to ſatisfie vs in him: but (as I haue ſaid) we deſpiſe &amp; ſet light by them. And ſo we are not worthie to taſte, what this promiſe is worth: <hi>I am with thee, and wil bleſſe thee.</hi> Now it is ſaid a litle after:
<q>That Iſaack erected an altar, and that he called vpon the name of the Lord in that place.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We haue ſeene already why altars were erected by the holy fathers, &amp; to what intent: but yet wee muſt here ſpeake ſomewhat of it, euen as the place requireth. The altar which Iſaack erected, was to this end, that he might make profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his faith. Thus much concerning the firſt point. For if wee pray vnto God, we haue no neede to erect an altar vnto him: the ſeruice of God is, of it ſelf, ſpiritual. Iſaack therfore erected not an altar that hee might only inuocate and call vpon the name of God, or make his praiers &amp; ſupplications vnto him: but to the intent that his faith might be knowen, &amp; that God might be glorified before men. For although we ought to ſerue God in ſpirite, and inwardly in our heart: yet notwithſtanding this letteth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, but that wee muſt giue him that prayſe which hee deſerueth before men, and that wee proteſt aſmuch as lyeth in vs, that wee are wholy his, both bodye and ſoule.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:125"/>
               <p>Here therefore we are inſtructed, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full after they haue put their truſt in God, &amp; ſhall haue called vpon him, &amp; giuen vnto him the praiſe of all his benefites that they muſt yet further make a confeſſion of their faith before men, to the intent they may wholy (as alſo all is his) dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to him. There is alſo a ſeconde reaſon: And that is that by reaſon of our ſlougth and ſlacknes, we haue neede euery maner of way to bee pricked forwardes, to the ende too ſtirre vs vp, to march cherefully forwards in the ſeruice of God. How ſo? It is true, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray vnto God, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſieth him ſelfe with no ceremonies: and yet for all that, we bowe our knees, we hold vp our ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds towards heauen, and vncouer our head. And why ſo? Firſt of all, in reſpect of men. For (as I haue alreadie ſaid) it muſt needs be that we do homage vnto God with our bodies, which hee hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which he hath appointed to his glorie, &amp; to the crowne of immortalitie. But, howſoeuer it be, foraſmuch as we are ſlacke, it behoueth vs that theſe meanes ſtande vs in ſteede to prouoke vs too haue a more feruent zeale to praye vnto God, and with a more heartie affection. Loe then, why it is meete for vs to haue our ioyned handes lifted vp, too kneele vpon our knees, and haue our head vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: For it is too ſhewe, that wee preſent our ſelues before God as if we ſhould ſay: And poore wretch, who art thou? with what lowlines ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt thou too come before him, who hath created and faſhioned thee, and to whome thou haſte to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7669:125"/> render an account of thy whole life? And againe this alſo, is to this end, that we ſhould bereaue our ſelues of all vaine fantaſies, that make vs to ſtray heere and there: and that wee ſhould wholly reſte vpon him. So then, the Aultar that Iſaack erected, ſerued to this purpoſe: to wit, that by this meane he might be the more prouoked, and haue his hart ſo much the more inflamed to ſerue God. And on the other ſide, he made a confeſſion before men, to giue example to his familie, and to teſtifie that he mingled not himſelf with the ſuperſtitions of the Panims: but had a pure and vndefiled religion, in aſmuch as he was ruled by his word. And thus much concerning the Altar. And by the way wee haue alſo to learne heere this thing which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared before, that the prayers of the holy fathers, and the confeſſion which they made of their faith, was not ioyned with the ſacrifices, for no other ende but to leade the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: For they were continually taught, that they could haue no acceſſe vnto God, but by the fauour of a mediatour, who was not yet ſent into the world: but yet ſo it is that they reſted there. But now that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is come downe, &amp; that hee hath taken our nature vpon him, &amp; hath ſaid vnto vs, <hi>That he is the light of the worlde, that he is the way,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iohn.</hi> 10</note> 
                  <hi>the trueth, and the life, that he is our aduocate to God his father, &amp; that through him we muſt haue entrance into Heauen:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore we haue all this, muſt we not bee ſo much the more aſſured, when there is any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of calling vpon him, that wee knowe that our
<pb facs="tcp:7669:126"/> requeſtes ſhalbe heard of him, and the gate ſhall be open for vs, &amp; that we ſhall alwaies find him rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and fauourable to help and ſuccour vs? Now howſoeuer it be let vs marke, that Altars in olde time, and ſpecially in the time of the law, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes erected to this end, that the faithfull might know that they were not woorthy to pray vnto God, nor to call vpon him in their own name: but that alwaies they muſt come to him by the means of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, &amp; by the vertue of that ſacrifice which he muſt offer vp to his father, for the reconciliation of the world. And indeede wee muſt not thinke that Abraham and Iſaack deuiſed Altars according to their owne fantaſies: For their ſacrifices were neuer acceptable but through faith as the Apoſtle ſheweth. Nowe they could neuer haue beene grounded in Faith, vnleſſe the word of god had gone before to enlighte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Let vs know then, that Iſaack offred not vp a ſacrifice, at all aduentures, as if he had thought, ô this ſhalbe found good: but he was taught, that hee beeing a wretched ſinner, he muſt not preſume to call vpon the name of God, vnleſſe he put his whole truſt in him, who muſt be ſent to make ſatiſfaction and to purge the ſinnes of the world The Panims had in deede their Altars, and ſacrificed, as did the holy fathers: but they wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted the principall. They were wholy occupyed in the ceremony, which of it ſelf was friuolous: becauſe they looked not vp to that heauenly paterne, wherof mention is made in Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticus. So then we haue to learne, that when our
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:7669:126"/> father Iſaac wold cal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the name of god, he had an Altar to witnes that hee could not be receyued but in the name &amp; fauor of our lord Ieſus Chriſt. And therfore at this day, as often as we will pray vnto God, let vs learne to waſhe our Prayes with the blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: for otherwiſe they ſhalbe but prophane &amp; defiled: but when the bloud of our lord Ieſus Chriſt ſhalbe applied ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, certainely our Prayers ſhalbe pure, they ſhalbe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated, in ſuch ſort, that God wil accept of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And when wee ſhall call vpon God, euery one in the ſecret of his owne hearte, let vs laboure alſo to drawe our neighbours therto, to the intent that he may be gloryfied in the middeſt of vs with one accorde. And as we ought to be knit togither in one Fayth, ſo alſo let vs haue but one mouth too proteſt that we holde him for our father and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, and that we are wholly his.</p>
               <p>But now wee will fall downe before the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of our good God, in the acknowledgement of our faultes, praying that it will pleaſe him, in ſuch ſorte to make vs feele them, that it may bee to make vs to bee diſpleaſed with our ſelues for them, and to make vs to lament before his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeate, to the intente wee may bee abſolued through his mercie: foraſmuche as wee ſhoulde iuſtly bee condemned by his iudgemente. And that it will pleaſe him to ſtrengthen vs, ſo as wee fainte not, whatſoeuer miſeryes wee haue too ſuffer in this worlde: but wee may meditate in his woorde in ſuch ſorte, that the onely promiſe
<pb facs="tcp:7669:127"/> which he hath giuen vnto vs, to holde vs for his children, may content vs, and that wee may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med therewith to the ende to ſubmit our ſelues to his wil peaceably to beare all afflictions, that he ſhall ſend vs: &amp; that we may gloryfie him alſo in our heartes, without any faigning or hypocriſie: and that wee may labour alſo to ſhow the frutes of our faith before men, and that by this meanes he may bee honoured of all, bothe of ſmall and greate. And that hee will not onely ſhewe vs this grace, but alſo to all peoples &amp; nations of the Earth, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Owſoeuer men liuinge in this worlde are ſubiect to many miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes and afflictions, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the moſte parte of the euils that they indure, proceede from them ſelues, euery one of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a Woolf to his companion. We are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with ſauadge beaſtes, who are altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our enemyes: there is neither Heauen nor earth, nor other elements, that doe not bring with them a thouſand hurts. We knowe not howe to goe vpon the water, but we muſt be, within halfe a foote of our death: There needs but one torment to ſwallow vp a people: The earth alſo hath many annoyaunces, as if God had threatened vs on eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide. But when we ſhall make compariſon, there are no wilde beaſtes, nor heauen, nor earth, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing whatſoeuer, which ſo much annoyeth men, as eche one annoyeth his neighbour. Nowe for this cauſe we ought to think it a ſingular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
<pb facs="tcp:7669:128"/> of God beſtowed vpon vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he giueth vs peace &amp; that we are not oppreſſed &amp; wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged on euery ſide, when no miſchief is deuiſed againſt vs, no hurt nor damage done vnto vs: It muſt needes be that the protection of God haue a hand in it, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that euery man will alwayes bee as a Woulfe vnto his neighbours, as we haue ſaid. And this is the marke whereunto this preſent ſtory tendeth: For Moyſes would ſhewe that after God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to Iſaack, he yet farther declareth his fauor vnto him, in that the Kinge of Gerar came vnto him, &amp; ſought his amitie and frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dſhip, &amp; hereby was Iſaack honoured, and ſpecially it was vnto him a great aduantage, becauſe he might alwayes haue beene in doubte, in aſmuche as hee had beene greatly inuied in the countrie, and had beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned to departe from thence, notwithſtanding he had liued amongſt them, in all humanitie and courteſie. He might therefore haue beene alwayes in great ſuſpence, fearing the rage of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. But God made them to come vnto him of their owne accorde, and not onely to ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues friends: but they flatter him, &amp; feare that he wil hurt them, and therfore they demaund a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to bee made betweene them with a ſolemne othe. Now we haue to note here firſt of all, that God hath the heartes of men in his owne hand to mollifie their hardnes, when it pleaſeth him, &amp; to abate al their rage, and to turne them to curteſie &amp; kindnes: for certainly the king of Gerar had not changed his nature, when he came to Iſaack: &amp; on
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:7669:128"/> the other ſide if he feared Iſaack, he might haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired with his ſubiects &amp; neighbors, and ſo haue ſet vpon him altogither. On the other ſide, hee had giuen no occaſion to doubte of him, in aſmuch as Iſaack had not giuen him any argumente of diſtruſting him: hee rather had behaued himſelfe in ſuch ſort, that he plainly declared that he deſired not to greeue any, no not ſo much as his preſence: For we haue ſeene howe hee departed from their company.</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be therefore that God ſtirred vp theſe prophane people, to cauſe them to come vnto Iſaack, and to ſubmit themſelues, as they doe with ſuch humilitie, that they intreate a poore man, a ſtranger, who had no great credite amongſt them, nor had any but his owne familie, which he kepte aparte, without giuing any token of attempting any ſuch matter. Before God had laid the bridle in their neck, but this was to proue the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was denied water, &amp; that in the end it was ſaid vnto him, that he was ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger then they, &amp; that he could be no longer ſuffred, there is no doubt but that God then exerciſed him to the end he might try what patience there was in him. And ſo Iſaack knew, that if it had pleaſed God to giue him peaceable dwelling in that Countrie where hee was, that he ſhould not haue beene dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen thence: but in aſmuch as hee ſawe men perke vp againſt him, he knew that it was as a paſporte from God for him to departe.</p>
               <p>Now on the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ttary we muſt alſo note, that god
<pb facs="tcp:7669:129"/> moued them vpon the ſuddaine to come towards Iſaack, and to appeaſe and aboliſh all enmities and quarrels, which might yet be moued either on the one ſide or on the other. Let vs marke well then, when any outrage is doone againſt vs, and there, where, we ſhal haue indeuored to do pleaſure and ſeruice to euery one, that we ſhall be wonderfully pricked and tormented, that this ſhould be doone by Gods appoyntment, who willeth vs to ſtriue, not in doing euill, or requiting euill for euill, but by poſſeſſing our ſoules in patience, as alſo our Lord Ieſus Chriſt hath thereto exhorted vs. And likewiſe on the contrary, when we ſhall ſee men to be fauourable vnto vs, and to intende no euill quarrel, or ryote againſt vs, let vs know that God hath pittie vpon vs, &amp; that he gouerneth his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and directeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſuch purpoſe as he ſeeth good. And likewiſe let vs beſeech God, as often as our enemyes ſhall vſe any crueltie againſt vs, and that we can not winne them by any meanes, nor by any moderation that wee can vſe, that it will pleaſe him to put too his hande, knowing that hee can turne when it ſhall pleaſe him, thoſe that are Wolues into ſheepe. This is, that wee haue to learne firſte of all by this Hiſtory. But it is ſayde that Iſaack at their firſte comming ſpake bluntly enough on this wiſe:
<q>Why are you come vnto me? ſeeing you hated me, &amp; draue me out from amongſt you?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wee ſhall ſee by the ſequel of the matter, that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:7669:129"/> Iſaack nouriſhed no ſpite nor bitterneſſe, nor any deſire of reuengement in his heart: For hee was quickly appeaſed: and when he vpbrayed Abimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech and all his company, that they had hated and perſecuted him: it was not in manner, of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie, ſo as we are accuſtomed to doe. For if any ſpite be done vnto vs, or any wrong, wee ſharpen our tongues to ſpeake euill and to ſlaunder: there is nothing but hatredes, contentions and wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: to be ſhort, if we could teare them in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that haue hurt vs, we would willingly doe it.</p>
               <p>And this is it that Solomon ſayth: <hi>That hatred diſcouereth reproches, faultes and iniuryes.</hi> When the hearts then are thus ſet on fire, it is not poſſible but that the tongues alſo muſt ouerflowe too outrage one againſt the other. But Iſaack tooke no ſuch courſe: but we haue to note, that whenſoeuer wee ſhall be patient that this letteth not, but that we vſe our libertie, to ſhew them that haue faulted, the wrong that they haue done vnto vs, and ſo make them to vnderſtande their offence: to the ende all may profite them.</p>
               <p>It is true that in this caſe we muſt thorowly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our affection: for it is a very hard and rare thing, that a man who ſhall haue beene prouoked &amp; offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that he ſhould not be moued with ſome paſſion, and ſo alwayes purſue his own particular cauſe. And therfore I haue ſaid that we muſt enter into our ſelues, and diligently marke, if we be not moued with ſome deſire of reuenge, or taynted with ſome hatred or rancour: when wee ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:7669:130"/> haue thorowely knowen this, and finde our ſelues cleere, then we may haue an open mouth to ſhewe them their offence, that ſhall haue wronged vs, not too be reuenged in condemning of them: but to the ende that they flatter not them ſelues in their ſinnes, as this is a very commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euil amongſt men. Loe then a poynt which we haue diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to marke: that is, that the patience of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is not without all touch of any paſſion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it againſt this, that we frankly ſhewe them: yee haue doone me wrong, and yee haue offended GOD, and yee haue had no occaſion to doe ſo: and yet: that they alwayes haue ſpeciall regarde vnto the ſaluation of thoſe, who haue perſecuted them, and haue beene their enemyes. For this that Iſaack nippeth them withall, was vndoubtedly as an admonition, whereby he ſought the good and ſaluation of them, to whome he ſpake ſo bluntly: For if he had diſſembled it, what profite might come to him thereby? The others woulde haue thought it depe hypocriſie, if he had made ſhew to haue byn contented &amp; wel pleaſed with them, and that he had nothing but honny in his mouth, and haue ſaid: Loe it is euen ſo: Abimilech knowing himſelfe to be faultie would haue thought, See, a double man and a lyer. Loe what they gaine that diſſemble ſo much, and ſet ſuch a faire cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance vpon it. So then, although the Children of God be patient, and that they be alwayes ready ro for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue all wronges committed againſte them, and haue not any maner of wayes ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cred harts againſt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:7669:130"/> their enemyes, yet they ceaſe not oftentimes too ſay, See wherein you haue done me wronge: and this is to ſhewe that they walke in all roundnes &amp; ſimplicitie. And this ende ought alwayes to be kept: that is to ſay, when wee ſhall bee greeued, or any wrong or extortion ſhall bee doone vnto vs, that yet wee procure alwayes the good of our enemyes, and that the reproofes and accuſations that we make vnto them, bee ſo many aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes or warninges to drawe them to the right way, and to touch them: too the intent they be not hardened and made obſtinate, and that they may be better aduiſed in time too come, and that they fight not againſt God, thinking they haue too do with men: as it is very like that Iſaack did here, who woulde likewiſe prouide for the time too come. For this ſhalbe very lawful for vs, when we ſhall haue ſuffred any wrong, to doe aſmuch as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in vs, to rid our ſelues from it. For although our Lord Ieſus Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth vs to be ready, when we ſhall haue receiued one blowe vpon the one cheeke to turne the other: Yet it meaneth not that we ſhould go &amp; prouoke our enemies, &amp; giue them occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to vexe vs. We ought to auoyd this aſmuch as is poſſible for vs: &amp; by all good and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing meanes wee ought to ſtop their malice who haue no feare of God in them. Iſaack then had reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to himſelfe in this caſe: But it was not too the ende too be auenged, nor to render like for like: He onely contented himſelfe to haue ſette a barre againſt all thoſe which had intreated him
<pb facs="tcp:7669:131"/> euill and dealte vniuſtly with him before time: to the ende they might be ſtayed, and might ſurceaſe from ſuch wrongs.</p>
               <p>This briefely is that we haue to learne out of this place. And this rule is very neceſſary: For of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes when men are reconcyled one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they muſt be ſilent and then there ſhall neede none other meane: and hee yet who ſhall haue ſuſtained the greateſt wrong, he ſhall haue more libertie and more boldeneſſe too iuſtifie himſelf, againſt them that woulde make vs beleeue that the Lambe hath troubled the water. Let vs marke well therefore, that when any ſhall haue doone wrong to his neighbour, if he come not to purſue his particular quarrelles ſo ſtoutly, that hee reſte therevpon, that it ſhall bee good that eche one be aduertiſed, and that hee which hath doone the wronge, notwithſtanding knowe it, confeſſe it, and be ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bled in it: but we ſee that this greatly profited not: ſo farre of was it that Iſaack pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued not the matter to the vttermoſte, although hee ſawe that his admonition was not receiued, and that it touched not their hartes, to whome he he had ſpoken: howſoeuer it was, hee delte not ſpitefully againſt them. Notwithſtanding marke Abimilech who ſayth:
<q>Like as we haue been friendly vnto thee, and haue doone thee no hurt, ſo ſweare vnto vs that thou wilte at tempt nothing againſt vs.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:7669:131"/>
               <p>Abimilech not onely hideth the euill which he hath committed, and would excuſe it: but he boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth that he hath done his dutie woonderful well towards Iſaack: and this is the common manner, as we haue ſaid: For there is nothing more harde for a man then to condemne him ſelfe: although he feele him ſelfe faultie. Men wil be drawen ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to any thing then to this lowlines, which yet notwithſtanding is a token neceſſarily required to true repentaunce. For if a man feele that hee haue faulted, and haue true repentaunce, he muſt needes confeſſe him ſelfe giltie before God, and likewiſe towards his neighboure, when it ſhalbe requiſite. And therefore our Sauiour Chriſt alſo exhorteth vs, that if we haue any quarrell againſt our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that is too ſay, if wee haue offended them, that rather we ſhould leaue our ſacrifices at the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, to the end to ſeeke agreement, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to flatter our ſelues, and to harden our hearts, deſpiſing thoſe to whom weare bound. Nowe he ſpeaketh of that time of the ſacrifices: but that was as much as if he ſhould haue ſaide, that we cannot pray vnto God, nor do any thing that ſhalbe acceptable vnto him, as long as we diſdaine to repaire the faultes which we haue committed. Now although God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vs neuer ſo ſtraightly to humble our ſelues, when we haue offended, yet can none attaine vnto this way: and that is heere ſufficiently taught vs in the perſon of Abimilech &amp; of his companions. For men are ſo blinded bothe with ſelfeloue, pride and arrogancie, that they can not in any caſe
<pb facs="tcp:7669:132" rendition="simple:additions"/> be brought to this, to ſay: I haue offended: for they are alwayes aſhamed to confeſſe their fault: and yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding are not aſhamed to be conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before God and his Angels: and yet whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they haue remorſe in them ſelues, they muſt condemne themſelues in ſpight of their teeth. They can trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trace out all the wayes that can be to maintaine their corruption, they haue their goodly ſtarting holes, to vpholde themſelues in their miſcheuous cauſe: but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhal haue woon both great &amp; ſmall, whether it be through corruption or fauor, or by any other meanes, and all the worlde ſtand for them, yet muſt they in the ende come to the iudgement of their owne conſcience which they cannot abide: and as I haue ſaide, there they ſhall find themſelues to haue gotten nothing by al their fetches &amp; ſtarting holes: For maugre their beards wil they nil they, they muſt feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues guilty before God. Nowe when this is ſet before vs, it is not to the ende that wee ſhould ſleepe in any ſuch vice: but to the intent, that we knowing our ſelues to bee ſubiecte vnto it, ſhould the rather ſeeke for remedie. When Moiſes ſaith therefore that Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milech made as if he had wel acquited himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Iſaack (and we knowe the contrary by that which hath beene rehearſed) it was not onely to ſhewe that Abimilech was an hypocrite &amp; a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man: but it was alſo to ſet a looking glaſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, to the ende wee might knowe that there is not any one amongſt vs, which is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyned to flatter himſelfe, and who is not bent to boulſter out an ill cauſe: although he were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:7669:132"/> conuinced to haue offended, that yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe pride would not ſuffer vs to ſubmitte our ſelues. Loe then Moyſes purpoſe and drifte. So then, what haue we to doe? that euery one gage and ſounde himſelfe to the bottome to finde what is in him: and after we haue duely examined our ſelues, we ſhall finde that there is not any one of vs that would not hide his faults, and that would not wronge his aduerſary, when wee haue any quarrell: and heerevpon it is that wee ſeeke out goodly coulours to excuſe our ſelues, and ſtarting holes &amp; delays: &amp; turn (as they ſay) black to white, and white into blacke, that wee might iuſtifie our ſelues. Seeing therfore that we are ſubiect to ſuch an euil, let vs fight againſt it. For it is not inough for vs to fele our vice, but we muſt forſake it, &amp; in forſaking it, we muſt yet reſiſt it, albeit we can not altogither get the vpper hand of it. And when we ſhal come to put this in practiſe, &amp; ſhal haue offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this man heere, and that man there, let vs not looke vpon men to bleare our eyes: but let euery man withdraw himſelf into his own ſecret, &amp; ſay, Go to, what can I do now? It is true that I might iuſtly do wrong vnto mine aduerſary: for he hath offended me thus &amp; thus: but notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding am I innocent before God &amp; his Angels? It is meete that I begin to iudge my ſelfe. For although that I be a poore blinde wretch, yet for al that I feele in my ſelf that I haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, &amp; I cannot ly vnto my ſelf: &amp; in the meane while wil God be deceiued? When I haue cunnnigly diſſembled, will not he
<pb facs="tcp:7669:133"/> finde out the leaſt drop for all that.</p>
               <p>So then there is no other meane to bee abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and releaſed before God, but this, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne my ſelfe. Marke then, I ſay, how we ought to practiſe this doctrine, and to apply it to our vſe and commoditie. And to be ſhorte, howe often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer we offend, let vs note that repentaunce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayneth in it confeſſion, not to goe and whiſper in the eare of a Prieſte, as was doone in the Papacie: but a confeſſion to giue glory to God, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make amendes for the faulte which was committed againſt our neighbours. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they who committed any wrong or outrage againſt another, it behoued them to labour the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment thereof, in humbling themſelues, and howſoeuer it was not to be aſhamed to ſay, I haue offended you: I pray you forgiue mee. For marke alſo howe we ſhall obtaine fauour and forgeuenes before God, and by what meanes thoſe wronges we haue done to our neighbours ſhall not cry out for vengeaunce againſt vs: For vndoubtedly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they to whom we haue done the wrong, content them ſelues, and think no more of it, yet the euil ſhalbe enrolled before God, &amp; cry more loude before his maieſtie, then if all men were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſet them ſelues againſt vs. So then, to the ende our faultes may be blotted out &amp; defaced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, &amp; that there be no cry that may haſten the Lord to iudgement againſt vs, by reaſon of the offences that we haue committed, let vs learne in ſuch ſort to appeaſe al ſtrifes &amp; quarrels that euery
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:7669:133"/> one may preuent it by humbling himſelf with an vpright &amp; pure co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſion. This is that we haue to marke vpon this point. Now on the otherſide, we ſee as I haue already touched, that Iſaack had not as a man would ſay, an hart puffed vp, neither that nouriſhed any manner of rancour againſt ſuch as had beene his enemyes: for he purſued them not, he had in deede ſpeciall cauſe againſt Abimilech and his company: For as Saint Paule ſayth, they which are not of the flock &amp; body of the church, we cannot iudge them, to the ende to bring them to repentance, as we may thoſe which make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianitie, who ought out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (as much as lyeth in them) to receiue admonition of their faultes. For this is the order which GOD hath ſette amongeſt al thoſe that are his, that wee ſhoulde bee ſubiect to receaue admonition bothe from great and ſmall.</p>
               <p>So that there is, as it were, a mutuall iuriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without the ſworde, and without authoritie, if we doe our duetie. For euery one hauing the word of God in his mouth is as a Iudge, to ſhew his neighbour the faultes which he hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. He ſhall be a iudge in one reſpect &amp; he ſhall ſuffer himſelf to be iudged in an other. Mark then, howe we iudge theſe that are of the houſholde, as S. Paule ſayth, that is to ſay, ſuch as are of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the Religion of the faithful, and of the children of God. But thoſe that are without, although we condemne them, yet can not we call them ſo familiarly, to ſay, Thou haſte offended.
<pb facs="tcp:7669:134"/> For they haue no ſuch acquaintance with vs, and there is no ſuch mutuall right, as there is amongſt the members of the body of the church. And this is the cauſe why Iſaack dealeth not ſo earneſtly with Abimelech and his people, as if they had bin knit together in one faith, &amp; worſhipped the ſame God, and had beene of one Church, and had had one and the ſelfe ſame order eſtabliſhed amongeſt them. It is very like that Iſaack would not haue paſſed this ouer to haue ſaide vnto him: What? Come you hither with your bragges, making as though you were my good friends, and had vſed nothing but courteſie towardes mee? And what courteſie was that to denie me water, yea and too damme vp the welles that I had digged by mine owne laboure and the ſweat of thoſe that were mine? And this could bring you no loſſe or hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: and yet through malice you haue gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to put out mine eyes: and in the ende you haue driuen me out and haue not ſuffered mee too dwell amongeſt you. And what friendſhip was this? Iſaack therefore might haue ſtoode too haue mainteyned his cauſe, if Abimelech had bene ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to haue receiued ſuch reproofe: but it was ynough for him freely to haue layde open his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For ſeeing Abimelech would not be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, neither had any ſuch repentance as was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for him: therevpon he leaueth him. So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, when we ſhall haue laboured to bring thoſe to re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pentance that haue offended, if we ſee them obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, we can no further preſſe or vrge them. It is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7669:134"/> true that if they be members of the Church, wee muſt followe them, to the ende they continue not obſtinate, and if they will not endeuour too open them ſelues, and that we ſee they will not bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with their faultes, that yet neuertheles we hold them as vanquiſhed. For marke howe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth vs to handle them who are ſo wilde and harde hearted. My friende, nowe thou ſheweſt thy impudencie: before I wel perceiued that thou waſt ſtrayed out of the right path: but nowe I ſee that thou art altogither deſperate and without hope: For thou doeſt manifeſtly deſpite God. And what getteſt thou either in this or in that? For thine offence is well knowen. And thus wee may very wel beate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe, who imagine through toughnes &amp; ſtubbernes to winne their cauſe. But if we haue to doo with thoſe, which haue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with vs, and are not our brethren, let it ſuffiſe vs too haue ſhewed them the trueth in one word: For this ſhalbe dearely inough bought of them, if they thinke not better vpon it to humble them ſelues. And for our part when we ſhal be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued for any offence, let vs not wayte for any long proceſſe and ſuch great enqueſtes too be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced as it vvere by fine force of many witneſſes: but let vs receiue correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> patiently aſſoone as it ſhalbe offred vs, &amp; not be like to thoſe that throvv vp an ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dful of aſhes, to take away the cleare light: let vs therfore co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe our faults: for this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedy, except we wil reſiſt god: &amp; let vs know that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any warning or admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7669:135"/> that then God would haue his grace felte of vs, and that hee is carefull too drawe vs backe, to the ende wee ſhould not periſhe, that wee ſhould not remaine obſtinate, and that Sathan ſhould not take poſſeſſion of vs. Let vs knowe this, too the ende wee may come to repentaunce and true low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Nowe Iſaack ſheweth yet better, that hee keepeth no minde of reuengement or enmitie, although they had offended him: For hee prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a banquet, and they eate and drinke togither. Loe here a pointe which wee haue well too me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vppon. For this alſo ſheweth, howe that we muſt fight agaynſt our paſſions, all the tyme of our lyfe: ſo that this is as it were the A b c of Chriſtians, not too requite euill for euill: but contrariwiſe too render good for euill, and to get the victorie in this matter: the which can not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into our fanſie. This I ſaye, is as it were oure A B C: and there is no ſuch perfection in vs, but that we ſhould beginne here: That ſo ſoone as wee deſire and haue a will to ſerue God, it behooueth that we be ſpoyled of all bitternes, hatred &amp; ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, of all deſire to reuenge, not onely to forgiue our enimies without procuring of their hurt: but alſo that wee bee readie too doo them good. But nowe who is hee that diſchargeth him ſelfe herein of the hundreth parte? But we ſhall find, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit it ſeemeth that many are (as they ſaye) petie Angelles, and haue nothing but a feruent deſire to ſerue god, &amp; to honor him, yea &amp; there is nothing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but loue, &amp; they are therin reſolute &amp; ſetled:
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7669:135"/> yet aſſoone as they bee prouoked, the poyſon ſo breaketh forth and afterwardes dwelleth ſo long in them, that they keepe the remembrance of ſome ſmall offence, in their heartes all the time of their lyfe. When we ſee therefore that we can not bee purged at the firſt daye, nor the firſt yeare, of this curſſed affection of reuenge, ſo much the more we muſt applie this remedie, to the ende we may bee ordred and gouerned by the ſpirit of God: not to remaine aſleepe in enimities &amp; rancours: but wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to forgiue them, and to be throughly pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in all things. And ſo, we ſhall haue well profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the tyme of our life, when wee ſhall haue learned, to what vſe this hiſtorie of Iſaack is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed vnto vs: that is, that hee prepared a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet for his enimies, not in a ceremonie, or for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion ſake onely, but to ſhewe that he was pure &amp; cleane from all malice, and that hee had forgotten and buried all the offences, whereat they might picke any quarelles. Nowe it is ſaide a little after:
<q>That they made a Couenant togither, and ſware eche to other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is true that Iſaack had the hurte, when the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demaunded of him, that hee would promiſe &amp; ſweare vnto them not to wrong them nor hurt them: For they had had ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t proofe, that they had not founde him a violent man, nor one giuen to doo any harme. Wherefore come they then to diſquiet him farther? He might haue put all this backe: but he dooth yeeld ſomething of his right:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:136"/> as when we would purchace peace amongſt men, we muſt alwayes haue this meane, not to giue it them wholly, who haue done vs wrong: but for all that, not too too extremely too chalendge and holde whatſoeuer belongeth vnto vs, without yeelding vnto them one cru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, (as they ſay) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For if euery man ſhould be ſo giuen to his own particular right, men could neuer bee vnited and knit togither: and although they were, they could neuer ceaſe from day to day too haue newe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to deuoure and eate vp one another. There is therefore but one way to nouriſhe peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde: and that is, that no man ſeeke that which is his owne: as alſo S. Paule maketh mention there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſpeaking vnto vs of Charitie, 1. Corinth. 13. Chapter, where hee ſaieth expreſſely, That Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hath this propertie, <hi>Not too ſeeke her owne.</hi> And further, when hee exhorteth vs too liue peaceably, and that wee ſhoulde loue brotherly fellowſhippe, and that none of vs ſhoulde giue him ſelfe too ambition, nor haue a deſire too bee more, greater, and higher, and too haue the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hande: For the woorde which hee vſeth, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, there ſhould bee no deſire of ſuperioritie or hauing the vpper hand. Now, as long as we ſhall haue this deſire (as I haue ſayde,) Loe as it were a fire blowed vp and kindled: there are a thouſande wayes which Satan will finde to ſet vs at ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corde, at warre, diſſention, &amp; ſuch contention, that it ſhould ſeeme we would ouerthrowe all. So, let vs marke well, to the ende that we may dwell in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:7669:136"/> friendſhip &amp; brotherly concorde with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, it behooueth euery one that he forſake and yeeld of his owne right, and that euery one keepe not this extremitie, to ſay, I wil keepe whatſoeuer is mine, &amp; will purſue it, and forgo nothing by no maner of meanes whatſoeuer. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal deale thus, certainly the Deuil will alwayes finde ſome cunning, to kindle the fire of diſcord and ſtrife of words, &amp; in the ende of warre. This therefore is that which we haue to learne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning this text. But here by the way wee ſee that it is lawfull for the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God to enter into league &amp; friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with heathen people, and ſuch as profeſſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but falſe religion: as long as it is not to ioine our ſelues with them, not too drawe in the ſame yoke. For we muſt marke well, that admonitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Paule, who ſaith: <hi>Take heede that you drawe not in the yoke togither with vnbeleeuers:</hi> For he ſpeaketh this by way of compariſon, as if two oxen were coupled togither, to drawe in one yoke, they muſt one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere the other: &amp; though they be wilde &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtraggle, yet beeing tyed together by the necks with the yoke, they muſt followe the ſame traine. Sainct Paule would ſhewe vs, that wee muſt not bee coupled with vnbeleeuers, in ſuch ſorte, that wee bee holden with their chaines, and that wee bee ſo entanged with them, that wee conſente vnto euill, neither in any reſpect too bee tyed therein: but onely for too nouriſhe peace, too ſtoppe outrages and violences, it ſhal alwayes be lawful for vs too enter into league with them.
<pb facs="tcp:7669:137"/> Let vs take heede therefore that wee bee ſeparated from all their malice, and therein that wee haue no acquaintance with them, &amp; eſpecially that wee condemne their iniquitie aſmuch as lieth in vs, ſo as we be not ſo much as companions and brethren with the wicked, no not complices: as it is ſayde, ſpecially in the 15. Pſalme, that we muſt hare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But neuertheleſſe, to ſtoppe their rage, and to take awaye all occaſion of hurte, and to ſhut the doore againſt them, to the ende they put not in practiſe their lewde enterpriſes, wee may well meet with their euill by making league with them, too the ende they may not flowe to all licentiouſnes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, when wee ſhall haue put ſuch a barre firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. Yea we ſee that God hath ſhewed vs this fauour and grace, that wee ſhoulde take his name to witneſſe, to the ende we might be aſſured either of other: whereby he ſheweth, howe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table a thing Concord amongſt men is vnto him, &amp; in what deteſtation he hath al quarelles, warres, wronges, hurtes, outrages and oppreſſions, which men ſhall doo eche vnto other. For this is no ſmall matter, that God giueth his owne name ſo to bee vſed, and as it were, pawneth it. And when a Prince muſt giue ſome of his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for hoſtage, hee will doo it with great difficultie and much a doe: but our Lorde giueth his owne Name for hoſtage, when there is cauſe of nouriſhing peace amongeſt vs, yea and when the matter ſtandes ſo, that Concorde muſt bee had with infidells, too the ende they may leaue of to rage againſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:7669:137"/> vs, and not hurt vs. Seeing then God hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed too lende his owne Name too this purpoſe, ſo much the more ought we too be bente, to ſeeke by all the meanes that can bee, that men may bee peaceable, and that wee haue no quarelles with them, yea that we ſeeke too appeaſe them that are raiſed vp: wee muſt (aſmuch as lieth in vs) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent them: but yet if wee can not altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme it, when we ſhall ſee any quarelles begun, wee ſhould endeuour too kill it: yea by the meane that I haue already ſpoken of: that is too ſay, by forgoing our right, aſmuch as ſhal be poſſible for vs. This then is the ſumme of that we haue too learne. Nowe it is not ſayd in this place, in what forme they ſware: but we ſhall finde afterwards, that Iſaack alwayes made his othe vnto the liuing and euerlaſting God, rendring honour vnto him too whom it belonged, albeit hee had to do with heathen people, who had forged idolles and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the true ſeruice of GOD through their owne ſuperſtitions: yet continued he in his owne ſoundnes. Therevpon it is ſayd, that his ſeruantes being returned, (as we expounded yeſterday) they ſayde vnto him: We haue founde liuing water. And after he addeth concerning Eſau:
<q>That he tooke a wife from among the Hethites, yea twoo wiues: which were bitter to the ſoules of Iſaack and Rebecca.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee on the one ſide, how God would comforte his ſeruaunt euery way: For it was not onely ſhevved him that he ſhould be aſſured from
<pb facs="tcp:7669:138"/> thence forth that none ſhould hurt him: ſeeing the king himſelfe of the countrie was come to ſeeke to him: but alſo he had water giuen him, which he might enioye peaceably and quietly as his owne. When therefore our Lord ſheweth this great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour towards Iſaack, let vs knowe that he te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pteth not his aboue their ſtrength, but alwayes ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their afflictions in ſuch ſorte, that they ſhall not be as it were euer oppreſſed &amp; quite ouerthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: and let vs hope, that altogither like as Iſaack was vpholden, and that God after he had afflicted him, looked alſo again vnto him to giue him ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what wherewith to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort him, ſo likewiſe muſt we waite, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſhal not be deceiued, if we reſt there, For God knoweth our fraieltie, and there is no doubt but he wil alwayes giue vs ſuch taſte of his mercie &amp; fauour, that we ſhall haue good cauſe to bleſſe his name, and haue no occaſion to grieue our ſelues in ſuch ſort, that we knowe not how to comfort our ſelues any more in him. But the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point is, that Eſau tooke two wiues from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Hethites. Here wee begin to ſee already that Eſau was not only once prophane, but that he went on in that courſe, and gaue him ſelfe wholy thereto, as we haue ſhewed heretofore, that after he had well filled his belly with the pottage, that Iacob his brother had prepared for him, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had eaten &amp; drunke, he went his way, &amp; deſpiſed his birthright. Moyſes alſo rehearſeth nowe that he tooke two wiues fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amongſt the Hethites: for if hee had had any remorſe within him, &amp; that he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:7669:138"/> had eſteemed the promiſe of the ſpirituall inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance made vnto his father, it is certaine, that hee would haue holden him ſelfe as ſeparate from all thoſe people. For hee knewe full wel, howe his graundfather Abraham had behaued himſelfe in that point, that he had made his ſeruant to ſweare ſolempnely, that he ſhould not take a wife for his ſonne Iſaack in that lande of Canaan: hee knewe that his mother was ſought after, in a farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in Meſopotamia, bicauſe god would haue this houſe as it were apart, &amp; would not haue it min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled &amp; maſhed with thoſe of that country. What doth he therfore, when he taketh two wiues of the inhabitantes of Canaan, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God had accurſed? This was aſmuch as if he had forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promiſe of ſaluation, and as though he had renounced, to make any more reckoning therof the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if it had not bin worth a ſtraw. Lo one teſtimonie alredy how Eſau made him ſelfe vnworthie of his birthright: &amp; this came to paſſe becauſe he was not gouerned by the ſpirit of God, as alſo wee haue ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that God wil ſo holde in &amp; keepe his elect, &amp; in ſuch ſort ratifie &amp; ſeale in their harts his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; fatherly adoptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they ſhal ſoare vp to him, &amp; deſpiſe this world, to the end they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice in thoſe ſpirituall benefits hee hath prepared for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe, he letteth looſe the reynes to al thoſe vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath reiected, in ſuch ſort, that they harde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues: &amp; although this be not done al at once at the firſt puſh, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhal find in the end, that there is no ſeed of the feare
<pb facs="tcp:7669:139"/> of God, nor of godlines in them. This therefore is the thing we haue to beare away vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this place. And herevppon let vs learne in ſuch wiſe too be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue our ſelues, that alwayes we labour to ſunder our ſelues from them, that would dravve vs too deſtruction: For it is vvithout al doubt, that if vve liue ouer familiarly vvith the contemners of god, they vvill ſoone defile vs: their fellovvſhip and conuerſation is a deadly peſtilence. And ſo much the rather it behoueth vs to vvalke vvith careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes herein, taking good heede vnto our ſelues that vvee defile not our ſelues vvith the filthineſſes of this vvorlde. And let vs in the meane ſeaſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that it is alſo a wonderful prouidence of God, that hee would haue Eſau too take twoo wiues in this countrie: For this was too this end, that he might be as it were cut of fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe of his father Iſaack: he loued him dearly, &amp; although his wiues vexed him, yet for all that hee could not withdraw his hart from Eſau, knowing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that God had reiected him. And herein he reſiſted God, without euer thinking vpon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but God wrought therin after another maner, when he ſaw ſuch infirmitie in his ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Iſaack, he brought to paſſe in the ende, that he muſt vtterly forſake his ſonne Eſau. Mark then how god ruled al in ſuch ſort, that his church co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinued alwaies in her ſmalnes, as it were hidden vnder the earth, as though it had bin nothing ther remained no more but Iacob, as wee ſhall ſee oftentimes, and Iſaack was halfe ſpent: he was three ſcore yeares olde,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7669:139"/> when his children were borne, and nowe was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau of the age of fortie yeares when he tooke his wiues: Iſaack therefore was very olde. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Iacob, he was alſo fortie yeares olde, and yet was not maried. And where then was this ſtock? It ſhould ſeeme that the Church muſt quite periſhe, and all the promiſes of God bee vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed: but although it were ſo ſmal, that it was contemptible in mens iudgements, yet we ſee that God ſo well gouerned his Church, that it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned pure and ſounde, &amp; that which was prophane was cut of from it: as if a houſe ſhould be ſwept, &amp; the ſweepings be caſt out of doores. So fell it out that Eſau was reiected, and that Iacob remayned alone, as alſo the heritage was appointed to him.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs fal downe before the high ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie of our good God, with acknowledging of our faultes, and praying him, that he will make vs to feele them in ſuch ſorte, that it may ſerue too make vs continually to mourne before him, and to aske pardon thereof in ſuch ſorte, that we may la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to reſiſt it, &amp; more and more be withdrawen from it, vntill we ſhalbe thorowly clothed with his rightuouſnes. And that he will ſupporte vs in our weakneſſes, ſo as we leaue not of to call vpon him as our father, although we fall many wayes. So let vs all ſay, O almightie God, heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſawe yeſterday, howe Eſau by his mariage, ſhewed ſufficiently ynough, that he had no great care concerning that bleſſing whiche had bin promiſed to the houſe of Abraham his father: For this was the ſtocke which muſt poſſeſſe the lande of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:7669:140"/> Canaan. It muſt therefore needes be, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which dvvelled there then, muſt be quite roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out: and this lande be vvholy dedicated to the people of God. Likewiſe, it muſt be purged from all polutions. Loe howe Eſau mingleth him ſelfe amongſt them, whom God had already condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: this therefore was a ſigne that he was falne from God, for otherwiſe he could not haue dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen neare too that people. And if he would haue bin an heire of the promiſe, he ſhould haue alwaies kept him ſelfe as one liſted &amp; chained in, and not haue mingled him ſelf, which was no other thing but to ſtoppe the courſe of the grace that was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. But as we haue ſeene, he tooke wiues from amongeſt the Hethites. Marke then howe hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, aſmuch as lay in him the grace of God, through vvhich the whole ſtocke of Abraham muſt poſſeſſe the lande of Canaan for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But there was yet a ſeconde faulte: For hee tooke two vviues, which vvas co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to the lawe of mariage, as wee haue ſeene. For the ſentence which God had pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to reſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was, that a man ſhall <hi>haue an helpe,</hi> and not tvvoo nor three. And further, when Eua vvas created, and that ſhee vvas giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is ſaid, <hi>that they ſhould be two in one fleſh.</hi> Mark then the rule vvhich me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought alvvaies to keepe. So then vvee ſee that Eſau euen brake the bounds of al honeſtie, yea of nature it ſelfe, &amp; that he vvas as a beaſtly man in this behalfe. It is true that his graundfather Abraham had tvvo vviues: but herein hee vvas too bee condempned.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:141"/>
               <p>And beſides it was not his deſire that prouoked him therevnto: but, his wife through ouermuch haſte, brought him to it. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euery thing ſhal be wel waied, it was an inconſiderat zeale that he had to enioy that which God had promiſed him: that is to ſay, that his ſeed ſhould be bleſſed. Nowe he had no childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. He tooke therfore a ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d wife: but this was (as I haue ſaid,) to peruert the order that God had eſtabliſhed. He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted euil therin: but in Eſau what can we alledge, but that he was a diſſolute man, &amp; had nothing but vice &amp; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in him, ſo that hee could not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene mariage and whoredome? And this is the cauſe that he tooke two wiues. Now it is very true that in this time, mariage was il kept amongſt the peoples of the Eaſt: For they were alwayes much giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their fleſhly luſtes: in ſuch ſort, that beyond that which is called poligamie (that is to ſay, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of wiues,) they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted inceſtes alſo very co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly. And this was a natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very beaſtly in this point, that they made no acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt to prophane ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage: but this cuſtome doth not therefore excuſe Eſau. And ſo, let vs marke wel, that this ſhalbe no excuſe before God, when wee ſhall ſay that euery man dooth ſo, and that wee haue a great ſorte of companions: let vs not thinke too bee free there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by before him. Notwithſtanding when vices doo raigne in a countrie, and men make a lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if ſome neglect them, euery man flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth himſelfe, and euery man taketh for his war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant thoſe vvhich haue led him too deſtruction.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7669:141"/> And (ſay they) ſuch and ſuch doe it well, and after when men come vnto them, and ſaye too them: wherefore doe you ſo? ô ſee ſuch a one did it wel. But we ſhall all bee put in a bundle togither, and God knoweth very well howe too wryeth vs vp altogither like thornes, when wee ſhall make a cloke of their vices, who ought when they doe euill to bee an example vnto vs, to make vs flye them. But notwithſtanding all this, that Iſaack is yet blinded with the loue of his ſonne Eſau: hee ſawe him nowe too degenerate out of kinde, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that he wallowed (as it were) a Swine vpon a dunghill, becauſe hee made a couenaunte with thoſe people whome God had reiected: and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peruerted the order and inſtitution of mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age: yet notwithſtanding his father beareth all this. It is ſaide, that the wiues of Eſau did as it were ſpurre him, and that his harte was wounded therewith: but ſo it is, that the loue of his ſonne did alwayes holde him back.</p>
               <p>Nowe there might well bee ſome vertue: but this meaneth not that euery thing was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore praiſe woorthy in him: no hee wanted mucn in that behalfe. For he ſhould haue had his ſonne, how olde ſoeuer he had beene in deteſtation, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as he was ſo eſtraunged from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe aſmuch as lay in him, he had made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of ſaluation of no effecte. For what might haue become of the Church, if the ſtock of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham had beene ioyned with thoſe people? Iſaack therefore ought to haue beene more touched, to
<pb facs="tcp:7669:142"/> ſee his ſonne ſo prophane. And ſeeing he ſawe this beaſtlyneſſe in him, that hee made no matter of it, to haue two wiues: and he woulde haue had them by dozens, if he had byn able to haue kept them. When therefore he beareth with theſe faultes in his ſonne, it is very certaine that he offended God. For vnleſſe fathers vſe ſeueritie &amp; correctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when neede requireth, when they ſee their children too be ſo wicked they are gilty, inaſmuch as they faile in doing their dutie. Our Lord hath giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie ouer their houſes &amp; offspring. And wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore, vnleſſe it be to the end to keepe them in awe and to reſtraine them, that they may render an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when any euill ſhalbe committed in their familie? Loe then a faulte ſhamefull inough in I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack: but yet hee exceedeth farther in doting ſo vpon his ſonne Eſau. It is ſayd, that his eyes began to faile him, foraſmuch as his ſight was dimme: but it is certaine that this fooliſh loue which hee bare to his eldeſt ſoone blinded him, much more then his age, or the lack of his bodily ſenſes: For he ought to haue marked (as the trueth was) that God had preferred Iacob before Eſau, &amp; yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles he reſiſteth it, as we haue ſeene before, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was ſaid that he loued Eſau, &amp; that Rebecca lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Iacob: and this loue of hers was an obedience that ſhee yeelded vnto that heauenly reuelation. For GOD had pronounced this ſentence before, <hi>That the elder ſhould ſerue the younger.</hi> Rebecca was a greate deale better aduiſed then her huſband. But hee continueth ſtil as wee may ſee in this place,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:7669:142"/> and it ſeemeth that hee would haue reſiſted God. It is very certain that his purpoſe was not ſuch: But hee is in ſuch wiſe rauiſhed by his affection, that he forgot himſelfe, and had no diſcretion and iudgement.</p>
               <p>And hereby we may ſee, how we ought alwayes too ſuſpect our affectionate paſſions. For they ruſh vpon vs alwayes to butte againſt God. As a Bull chafed puſheth with his hornes, ſo our appetites &amp; deſires driue vs, and rauiſh vs, in ſuch wiſe, that we make war moſt notoriouſly againſt god, yea with out euer thinking vpon it: it neuer commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our memory, This is forbidden me, God hath condemned &amp; reiected it. We haue therfore ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times our ſenſes ſo incumbred, that wee keepe not either the way or the path. And heereof we ſee an example in Iſaack. For all the time of his life, he was as a looking glaſſe of holines, &amp; led as it were an Angels life, keeping himſelf in the feare of god: but herein he ſo faulteth, that god is nothing with him. He treadeth vnder his foot that which he had vnderſtood by his wife: that is, that nowe the right of the firſt borne was giuen vnto Iacob. Neuertheles he paſſeth beyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that. Now this is a wonderful ſtraunge thing for he was notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the miniſter of god, &amp; a prophet: &amp; as ſone as he had charge to giue the bleſſing to him to whom God had ordained it, yet hee dealeth as if he had beene the keper and appointer thereof. God had doone him this honour, as if hee ſhoulde haue ſayd, I wil bleſſe him whom I ſhall thinke good:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:143"/> but the teſtimonie ſhall come out of thy mouth. Thou ſhalt be a meſſenger: eſpecially that which thou pronounceſt, ſhall haue authoritie of iuſtice: it ſhall be authentique, which I will ratifie in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, God had doone him this honor: and yet he leaueth himſelfe to be ſo ſnared in ignorance, that he goeth quite contrary, ſpecially from his dutie, and from that which his office required. This at the firſt ſhew ſhould ſeme a thing intollerable: but God, who by his woonderfull counſaile directed him in ſuch ſorte in this matter, that he turned darkeneſſe into light, &amp; ſhewed that this was not a thing according to mans fantaſie, that the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of ſaluation ſhould come vnto this man or too that man: but that in deſpight of all men, hee muſt haue it to whom it was ordained &amp; eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to holde it, &amp; that it muſt haue his effect. But becauſe all thinges can not be vnderſtood atonce, let vs folowe that order in rehearſing of it, which Moiſes vſeth: and afterwardes we will gather in the ende, the profite that this Hiſtory bringeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs. It is ſayde that Iſaack ſeeing himſelfe now to drawe towardes his ende, foraſmuch as he was tranſitory. He ſayth vnto his ſonne Eſau:
<q>I knowe not the day of my death: And therefore goe and hunt Veniſon that thou mayſt prouide me meate accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my appetite, and which I loue, and my ſoule ſhall bleſſe thee,</q>
               </p>
               <p>Iſaack in ſaying that hee knewe not the day of his death, ſignifieth, that he ſaw himſelfe to draw
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:7669:143" rendition="simple:additions"/> neere to the graue already: For there is none that knoweth the day of his death. God would always holde vs in ſuſpence &amp; doubt concerning this, too the end we might alwayes be ready. Death (as it is ſaid in the common prouerb) is ſure to all, but the houre of death is vnknowen vnto vs: &amp; this is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable for vs: for weſe how men are giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to their pleaſures &amp; are mery whiles that they think to haue ſome truſes or ſome releaſe. And what ſhould this be, if we knewe certainly of the ende of our life? Euery one would bend himſelf to all kinde of euill, and God ſhould be deſpited euen to the ende. But when our Lord handleth vs ſhort in ſuch ſort, that from the wombe of our mother we are ſtill beſeeged with death: as wee ſee of younge infants, who die before they come into the world: ſo far is it off, that we cannot liue euen the minute of an hower, but that as ſoone as we are borne we are ſubiect too death, as our frailtie declareth. For with what a number of deſeaſes are wee co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed? And to how many dangers and haſards is our life ſubiect? So then, there is neither younge nor olde that ſhould not ſay by good right, that he knoweth not whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhal dy but the meaning of theſe words is as I haue ſaid: to wit, that Iſaack knew wel that he could not continue in the worlde. And indeed, although young people &amp; they which are ſtrong and in the flower of their age, ought too prepare themſelues to forſake the world, &amp; euery houre to dye, while they liue: yet do we moſt faile heerein, albeit our nature warneth vs to giue our ſelues no
<pb facs="tcp:7669:144"/> more to the worlde. So that we haue to gather of this drifte of Iſaack, that as euery man ſeeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe weake and tranſitory, ſo that hee drawe his legges after him, where he hath liued longe, that this (I ſay) ſhould ſtirre vs vp ſo much the more to prepare our ſelues to dye. Nowe it is very true that he ſpake heere to no other ende, but to bleſſe Eſau: but ſo much this admonition importeth, that when we ſee death to approch, that we learne freely to yeelde vp our ſelues into the handes of God, and to glorifie his name in ſuch obedience, that we liue no longer to our ſelues: and after wee ſhall haue diſpoſed of euery thing in ſuch ſort, that there be nothing that holde vs or let vs, from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cheerefully forwards when we ſhall be called. But when he ſpeaketh of the blesſing, this is not to be vnderſtood of common praier. For there is no dout, but that Iſaack praied euery day for his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: and it is ſaid here: <hi>That I may bleſſe thee before my death.</hi> We may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gather that this blesſing wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Iſaack ſpeaketh, was had in ſpecial regard: &amp; in deed (as I haue ſaid) Iſaack was as it were the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and keeper of Gods promiſe: and this treaſure was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted into his charge &amp; credite, to bleſſe. And marke why the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>The leſſer was ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed of the greater,</hi> becauſe it muſt needs be, that in this caſe he muſt haue his authoritie from God. This was declared more plainly in the time of the law: For the prieſts were ordained, not onely to teache the people, and to offer vp ſacrifices: but alſo too bleſſe, and the very forme thereof was ſet downe vnto them. And oftentimes when Moyſes ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:7669:144"/> of this office, he ſetteth the Prieſtes whome God had choſen to bleſſe. But they doe this, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their owne perſons, no otherwiſe then as figures: but this was to ſhewe that it belonged to our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, to be a witneſſe vnto vs of the blesſing of God, and to ratifie it towardes vs: as alſo he ſhewed when he aſcended into Heauen, and that his handes were lifted vp, hee bleſſed his diſciples. He ſheweth therefore that the trueth and ſubſtance of theſe figures of the law, was fulfilled in him. Now he was ſo, before the law was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: for God would that Abraham ſhould be the father of the church: and for this cauſe he bleſſed Iſaack, as if the heritage had bin reſigned too him, which had byn promiſed to him. Iſaack now muſt doe the like: for he receiued not the blesſing for him ſelfe, but to the end it ſhould alwayes remaine in his houſe. He muſt therfore be the miniſter of the grace of God: as we yet ſee at this day, that he communicateth his benefites &amp; ſpirituall giftes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs, by the hand of thoſe whom he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to this purpoſe. Men therfore cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue vs our ſinnes, and yet neuertheles our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt vſeth this figure of ſpeking: <hi>To whom ſo euer you ſhall forgiue their ſinnes, they ſhalbe forgiuen.</hi> Now yet for all that he hath reſerued this to him ſelf as he proteſteth in Eſay. <hi>O Iacob it is I and none others that take away thine iniquities.</hi> Now albeit God alone hath this power to forgiue ſinnes, and too purge vs fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ſpots: yet neuertheles, he doth this by the hand of men. We haue in Baptiſme an infallible token that GOD will not lay our offences too
<pb facs="tcp:7669:145"/> our charge: but that we are as righteous &amp; cleane before him: and farther wee haue an earneſt, that he will renewe vs by his holy ſpirit, to the end wee ſhoulde walke in all puritie. Nowe this can not bee giuen vs of men: but yet GOD maketh them heerein as inſtrumentes, and all through his fauour. Againe, Is it in the power of any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall creature, too make vs partakers of the body and blood of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte? And yet neuertheleſſe in the ſupper when the breade &amp; the wine are diſtributed, it is certaine that this is not a vaine and emptie figure, but that all is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyſhed, and that our Lord Ieſus Chriſte ſheweth him ſelfe faithfull in this: For it is hee which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it: &amp; it were too much to attribute it to thoſe who are and can doe nothing, to ſaye, that they haue our Lord Ieſus Chriſte to communicate to them which come vnto them to receiue a morſell of bread, and a drop or twoo of wine. And in deede this is wel ſhewed vnto vs, when he ſayth: <hi>My fleſh is bread from heauen.</hi> And hee giueth it after two ſortes: one is, that which he gaue, when hee offred vp him ſelfe to his father for the clenſing of ſinnes. <hi>The breade which I will giue vnto you</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>is my fleſh which I will giue for the life of the worlde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Loe then two kindes of giuing: for hee gaue his fleſhe, when he offred it vp for the ſatiſfaction of all our faultes, to the ende that God might bee appeaſed towardes vs, and that we might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed to become righteous. Now the ſeconde gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing is that which he maketh dayly. Nowe if it
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:7669:145"/> belong to Ieſus Chriſt to giue himſelfe vnto the faithfull, who receiue him by faith, it followeth then that this ought not too be attributed to men, not as though they had this power: but onely that Ieſus Chriſt ſurceaſeth not to apply this thereto. And thus it hath beene in all times: For God hath euermore reſerued to himſelfe the praiſe of mens ſaluation: but this letteth not, but that theſe may be inſtrumentes by whome hee worketh. Loe then howe this maketh for Iſaack, to ſhewe that hee muſt pronounce the ſentence of that bleſſing whereunto he was ordayned. And in deede wee ſee this in the doctrine of the Goſpell: for what is the preaching of the Goſpell? <hi>It is the power of God to ſaluation to all beleeuers</hi> (ſaith Saint Paule:) &amp; there he ſpeaketh of that word which proceedeth from our mouth. What, the power of God? Why, it is nothing in it ſelfe. It is true: but it pleaſeth God to diſplay his power by the meanes of men, and would that his worde ſhould haue ſuch effect and power in the working, that it be as it were a key to open vnto vs the kingdom of heauen: as alſo he hath compared it to the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen.</p>
               <p>So then, let vs marke well that Iſaack ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not heere of any common bleſſing: that is to ſay of prayer, as when wee bleſſe one another, and when wee pray that God will ſhew mercy to our neighbours, &amp; that he wil giue them that which he knoweth to be fitte for them. And thus much concerning blesſings. But Iſaack knew that
<pb facs="tcp:7669:146"/> he was ordained the miniſter of God to diſpence that treaſure that was committed to his charge. And this is worthy to be noted, to the end that we hate not the doctrine that is preached vnto vs, knowing what it importeth.<note place="margin">Theſe be the Anabaptiſts that refuſe the miniſtery of the worde, and will be taught im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</note> For there are many fantaſticall men that refuſe all inferiour meanes, &amp; would without wings mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vp aboue the clouds. And is not God, ſay they, ſufficient to teach vs? Is it not he that giueth faith? And is the holy Ghoſt in the hands of men? what neede haue we too be preached vnto? And to what ende is it to reade ſo much? All this is ſuperfluous: For God can ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently enſpire vs, without hauing our eares ſo bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred with the toung. For he hath al that is needful for our benefite and ſaluation: and he wil bring it to paſſe. And muſt men then holde him as it were bound to them? And muſt the power of his ſpirit be maſhed &amp; mingled with thoſe inferior meanes as though he were not at libertie? Loe what theſe fantaſtical ſpirits ſay. Now they conſider not that God is not tyed and bound to men, when he vſeth their ſeruice: for he doth it as it ſeemeth good vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. It is true that faith ordinarily commeth by hearing, as S. Paule ſaith: ſo that we can not haue faith vnleſſe it be by men. And cannot God aſwell doe it otherwiſe? The queſtion heere is not of the power of God but of his wil, &amp; of that which hee hath ordained. And therefore when we ſhall ſay, And cannot God doe this and that? he can doe it: but ſeeing he will that it be otherwiſe, we ought to reſt there. So then, let vs learne to receiue this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:7669:146"/> which is dayly taught vs, with all reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, knowing that when we ſhall haue this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie, that our ſinnes are forgiuen vs, all is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified in heauen: as if God himſelfe ſhould ſpeake: For he will not haue vs to eſteeme his trueth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to men, who are brickle and lyers and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt whome there is nothing but vanitie: but he wil haue his truth eſtemed for it ſelf ſake, &amp; for it owne nature. And in the meane time, let vs haue this ſobrietie and modeſtie therein, too ſubmitte our ſelues too the order which hee hath eſtably<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And thus much concerning this worde of bleſſing.</p>
               <p>Nowe heere Moyſes beginneth too rehearſe howe Rebecca founde out a ſubtiltie and craft to robbe Eſau of his bleſſing, and too tranſlate it too Iacob: and after that we haue ſpoken of the vices of Iſaack, we ſee the like in his wife Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: and yet neuertheleſſe they bothe beleeued in God: notwithſtanding that it was ſo darkened and bewrapped, that it could hardly be diſcerned. That Iſaack had a true faith: and that this procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from a true zeale, it appeareth plainely: For if he had not beene thorowly perſwaded heereof in himſelfe, that the heritage ſhould be giuen him which was promiſed to him, and to his ſeede con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this bleſſing: What had this byn? Surely but a craftie parte and a thing of nought. Iſaack therfore muſt needs be reſolued, howſoeuer hee ſaw himſelfe as it were already in the graue, his life to bee ſpente, and to haue but a day too liue:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:147"/> howſoeuer this were, yet neuertheles he alwayes helde this ſure which was ſaid vnto him: to wit, that his familie ſhoulde be bleſſed, and that GOD had choſen him, and that this was not in vaine, &amp; that albeit he ſawe not the fulfilling of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in this world, yet notwithſtanding that god was in heauen, and that neither he nor his ſhoulde be deceiued: but yet they muſt waite for this. Wherefore Iſaack hauing fought al the tyme of his life againſt al the tentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which might haue ouerthrowen him, doeth yet in death perſeuer in fayth and patience, and doth this honor vnto God that he doth boldly truſt in him. For whoſoeuer truſteth in God ſhal neuer be confounded. Iſaack had this, &amp; this was a very excellent faith. For ſee a poore wayfering man: it is ſaide vnto him, <hi>thou ſhalte bee the heire of this countrey,</hi> and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding he had no water to drinke as we haue ſeene. Nowe notwithſtanding death doth threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: yet knoweth he not when it ſhalbe, ſauing that he is altogether readie for it. And yet for all that he deſpiteth both Sathan and the worlde, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth ſtedfaſt in this, that God wil not deceiue him: &amp; that it is al one to him whether he dye, or whether he molder in the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: ſo that the truth of God may yet continue, &amp; haue his ful vertue and power. Lo Iſaack the who ſeeketh not for the worlde, but forſaketh al his ſenſes and remaineth ſtedfaſt: &amp; douteth not but that god had mercy on him &amp; on his ſtock. Herein as I haue ſaid we haue good cauſe to praiſe him: &amp; yet in the meane time
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:7669:147"/> he was ſo blinded with the loue of his ſonne, that he fought againſt God, though hee neuer once thought therof. This was not a manifeſt rebellion nor of wilful malice: but it was becauſe hee was ſluggiſhe and knewe not his office but in parte. He knoweth very wel that God would aduaunce him to ſuch a dignitie, that he might bee the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger and witneſſe of this bleſſing: Hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this, and notwithſtanding on the contrary parte hee is deceiued. Hee had therefore in this caſe a particular Fayth: he had a good zeale ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the affections of the fleſhe.</p>
               <p>But let vs come too Rebecca. Rebecca beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haued her ſelfe heere with fooliſhe raſhneſſe: for what an attempte was it, for the bleſſing of God, too be prophaned through crafte and lying? yea, (I ſaye) lying ſo foule as nothing colde be more. The matter was heere of the ſaluation of the worlde, the queſtion was of hauing Ieſus Chriſt whome GOD ſhould ſend for a Redeemer. But how proceedeth Rebecca theerein? It is certaine that a thing of ſuch importance ought too bee handled with all feare and lowelyneſſe: what a thing is it then that ſhe commeth fooliſhly too attempte that which ſeemeth good vnto her, in ſo excellent a woorke of GOD and which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth all others? For Rebecca knowing wel that the bleſſing which ſhee ſought for her ſonne Iacob imported that hee ſhould bee heade of the Church during his life, and that of him ſhoulde come our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte: doth notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb facs="tcp:7669:148"/> ouerthrowe it, that ſhee careth not too lye, to falſifie, to peruert all: and alſo it ſeemeth, that ſhe ſetteth out the grace of God but in a moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery and contempt: For this was too make it too bee baſely eſteemed, to ſay, that it ſhoulde come bewrapped aboute the necke of her ſonne, and in the handes of ſkinnes, coulouring that hee is hairie, and ſeeming too robbe Eſau of all his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes: and againe that ſhe maketh her ſonne to lye: &amp; farther Iacob, who went to ſeeke a Kid which ſhee cauſeth to be ſodde, and maketh him beleeue that it is Veniſon: And after that he had the ſmell of the garmentes of Eſau: to bee ſhorte it might be ſaide that ſhe would haue ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the election of God.</p>
               <p>Loe therfore very foule faultes, and yet all this proceedeth from an excellent faith, if euer there were any. This is very ſtraunge: But wee maye eaſily iudge it. Whereto then had Rebecca re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde? She looued her Sonne Iacob, and what ſhoulde it auayle him to haue beene bleſſed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe deceite? For this was neither to gette him ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches nor profite in reſpecte of the worlde: yea which is more ſhe layeth him open to the wrathe and curſe of his Father: Againe ſhee knewe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſau who was ful of venom, ful of fierceneſſe, ſpight and wrath: and indeede wee ſhall ſee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, that Iacob was in danger of his life: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca knewe all theſe thinges, notwithſtanding ſhe ſetteth fire on her houſe, where ſhe might haue kept her darling with her, to haue beene alwayes
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:7669:148"/> with him, to haue adminiſtred that vnto him which he might haue needed in the worlde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting him in any ſuch daunger. But what did ſhee? ſhe had printed this in her hearte that the birthright belonged vnto Iacob, as GOD had promiſed her, and ſo ſhe woulde obey God, and eſteeme this birthright, although it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing accounted off amongſt men: as wee ſhall afterwardes finde, that Iacob called Eſau his Lorde, that hee humbled him ſelfe before him, yea, euen to the bowing of the knee.</p>
               <p>Nowe although that this ſame birthright were worth nothing in reſpecte of the world, yet doth Rebecca greatly eſteeme it. See then vndoubted and ſure teſtimonies of a great and exquiſite faith which was in her, that ſhee would obey God in deſpite both of her huſband and all that he had: ſo that ſhe mighte execute that which God had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, ſhe paſſed not: And that ſhee eſteemed theſe ſpirituall bleſſinges more then any thinge which was in the worlde. Loe then the vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted markes of her faith, ſhe had ſo greate zeale that ſhe forgot her ſelf and regarded not any whit whatſoeuer miſcheife might come vpon it. And why ſo? For aſmuch as ſhee conformed her ſelfe to the will of God: and forſooke her eldeſt ſonne, &amp; caſt of all motherly affection: and knowing that he muſt be cut off: very well ſayeth ſhee, let him goe as a rotten member for aſmuch as God hath ſo ordayned. Wee ſee heere in Rebecca notable vertues mingled with vices.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>And heereby wee are admoniſhed too walke in feare, albeit that God giue vs a ſingular affection to meditate vpon him, notwithſtanding wee ſhall alwayes be in ſuch ſorte bewrapped in darkeneſſe, that when wee imagine to doe the beſte wee can in the worlde, yet there ſhall be cauſe for vs too amend when GOD ſhall call vs to a reckoning. And in good ſooth, there is not any one which doth not proue this to be true: for although that this bee our marke, too ſtriue thither whether God hath called vs, yet doe wee make ſo many falſe ſteppes that it is greate pittie to ſee: and they which run more ſwiftly doe bring themſelues in order to God, yet for all that, they go out of the way and haue many outlopes &amp; croſſe pathes, &amp; God ſuffreth them to the ende that we ſhould not haue whereof to be proude. For if vertues them ſelues be faultie before God, alas what ſhall thoſe vices bee which are altogither condemned? Doe wee labour too doe well, doe wee enforce our ſelues therevnto: yet notwithſtanding wee ſhall offende GOD. And why ſoe? It is becauſe there is ſuch infirmitie in vs, and wee are wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ignoraunce: Although that GOD inlighten vs, and that wee ſee the way well, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, yet ſuch cloudes doe oftentimes come before our eyes, that in ſteade of keeping of our way, vve ſtray either on the one ſide or on the other.</p>
               <p>Mark how faultie the vertues of the faithfull are, to the end that we may learne, only to reſt our
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:7669:149"/> ſelues in the meere goodnes of God, &amp; to the end it would pleaſe him to pardon our offences, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to accept that for rightuouſnes which he might iuſtly condemne. Howe then is it that our works are acceptable vnto God? howe is it that hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſacrifices of a ſweete ſmelling ſauour, and that they are ſo acceptable before him, that they ſhall haue a rewarde? Alas, it is not any merite as the Papiſtes imagine: but it is becauſe that God hath iuſtified that, which hee might rightly reiect, and accompt as it were abhominable. So let vs marke that in the faith of Iſaack, wee may beholde the imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which are in vs, whiles that we liue in this world, albeit that God haue renued vs in parte by his holy ſpirit, and againe let vs knowe that God worketh in ſuch ſort that the euil which is in vs, hindreth not him to accompliſh his work euen by our meane. As for example, If wee will ſearch till we finde an Angelicall perfection in a mortal man, there ſhall neuer any be founde that hath it, neither was euer any founde who was not tainted with ſome kinde of fault: and therefore the Prieſtes which were figures and repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, firſt of al asked par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for their offences, although that they made interceſſion for the people, and were as it were mediators, and that by their ſacrifices they aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ſinnes: yet notwithſtanding muſt they begin at them ſelues. But nowe by the way if wee will ſeeke miniſters of the vvorde, in vvhome there is no fault, it is certaine that vve cannot finde any:

                  <pb facs="tcp:7669:151"/> and it muſte needes bee that the moſt excellent men be examples vnto vs, of the brickleneſſe and weakneſſe of men. But nowe if wee will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: and howe then ſhall I finde my ſaluation by their meanes? For I ſee yet that they are full of imperfections. But let vs learne (as I haue ſaid) in the perſone of Iſaack that God leaueth not off too accompliſhe his woorke, although there bee yet ignorance in them, who ought too leade vs, vvho vvhen they diſtribute vnto vs ſpirituall giftes, which they haue committed vnto them, and whereof GOD hath made them keepers, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be not altogyther ſuch as they ought too bee: notwithſtanding wee leaue not off too make our profite of them: for God vſeth and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth them in ſuch ſorte in this worke which he will doo, that his grace is no whit hindered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a man might finde thinges too bee bettered in them. This therefore is the thing that we haue yet too marke vppon this place. But too be ſhort, wee ſee that the faith of the children of God ſhall oftentimes be weake and entangled, not as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes haue imagined: for they call an entangled faith beaſtlineſſe, when a man ſhall ſaye, O, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in my mothers god: I knowe not what the whole Chriſtianitie meaneth: But lo it is inough for me too goe ſimply to worke: and I beleeue as our holy mother the Church beleeueth: and in deede the wiſer ſorte of Prieſtes will ſaye, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in the god of my Chambermaide: bicauſe ſhe beleeueth in god who maketh Cabadges to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7669:151"/> growe after that ſhee hath planted them. See the implicite and folded fayth of the Papiſtes, which is a very ſorcerie of the Deuil: but the entangled faith of the children of GOD, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they bee holden in ignorance. But yet notwithſtanding there is ſome light: but what is that faith? It is an vnderſtanding which wee haue of the goodneſſe and fauour of GOD, after that hee hath illuminated vs by his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite and by his woord. For faith can not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe two things: that is to ſaye, without the word of God: I ſaye as God hath ſet an order in his church: and after it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be without the gift of the ſpirit: For the word of god ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vnto vs both morning &amp; euening, and wee can profit nothing therein, vnleſſe God doo open our eares and enlighten vs, foraſmuch as wee are miſerable blinde ones. The Sunne ſhall alwayes ſhine vppon vs: but they that are blinde diſcerne not betweene the daye and the night, too them both are alyke. And euen ſo is it with vs: that if GOD illuminate vs not within, when hee ſendeth his holye woorde, too ſhewe vs the waye, wee ſhoulde alwayes remayne as poore ſtrayes, or loſt ſheepe.</p>
               <p>So then, it behooueth that oure fayth haue light in it ſelfe: but yet I ſaye, that this light is compaſſed and entangled with great darkneſſe: For wee beholde not God face too face, and wee are not capable too comprehende his ſecretes: and this is ſufficient that wee knowe them in part,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:152"/> and that we haue ſome taſte of that which ſhall be reuealed vnto vs in perfection, then when we ſhal put off our fleſh, &amp; ſhalbe tranſlated into that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly glorie, to be companions of Angells. Loe then briefly what wee haue to learne vppon this place, to wit, that our faith, although it be great &amp; exquiſite, yet neuertheleſſe it ſhall alwayes haue ſome weaknes, and ſome imperfection and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance mingled with that, which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs to know. Nowe hereof we may gather, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcripture pronounceth that we are iuſtified &amp; ſaued by faith, it meaneth not, that it is by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert of faith: For if it were ſo that our ſaluation were founded vpon the dignitie of faith, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt our faith be perfect. For if our faith be weake (as I haue already ſaid) and that we haue but onely a part of it, then ſhould we haue but a part of ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and further it ſhould be ſhaken, &amp; we ſhould alwayes be wauering and in doubt. But when it is ſaid that we are ſaued by faith, it is bicauſe we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the mercie of god, which we ought to eſteme fully ſufficient for our ſaluation. Our faith is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: yea but when there ſhal be neuer ſo little a ſparke, yet neuertheles ſhall the goodnes of God ſupplie that which is wanting: euen as wee nowe beare this corrupt lumpe, not onely in oure bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, but in our whole nature. But we know that our ſoules goe vnto death, and in the meane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon where is our life? It is in vs. How? In that we haue receyued the ſpirit of God, ſaith Saint Paule in the 8. chapter to the Romanes. And haue vvee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7669:152"/> the ſpirit of God in fulnes? No not ſo: There is as it were but one ſparke or droppe of it: but this ſaith he is life: and ſhall ſwallowe vp all whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer belongeth to death in vs, and ſhall make it of no effect. Let vs marke then that although our faith be very little, and that in reſpect of vs we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not the hundreth part of the benefits which God offreth vnto vs, yea and that we doo not ſo much as by a licke, taſte his grace, yet neuertheles we muſt not therefore deſpaire too bee ſaued tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough faith. For the matter is not as I haue ſayde, of our eſtimation, or of our paiſing and waying it in our ballance, that is to ſay, if wee haue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent faith to obtaine the grace of God, and that which is neceſſarie for our ſaluation: but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion only is, that when God hath declared that he wil be our father, that we imbrace this promiſe, &amp; ſtay our ſelues therevppon. And if there bee any doubtes or diſtruſtes, that we reſiſt them, and that we holde faſt this concluſion, O wee are yet ſure that God will not diſapoint vs. Marke then what we haue here too holde, aſwell by the example of Rebecca, as by the example of Iſaack. But Moyſes ſayth nowe expreſſely that Iacob refuſed, ſaying:
<q>And howe ſhall this be? I am not hairie as my brother is, and if my father ſhall finde the deceyte, hee will curſe mee.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here wee ſee as it ſeemeth, two great vices in Iacob: The one is, that hee feared his father more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God. It is true that it might ſo be iudged ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:153"/> but when all ſhall be well marked, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that it was the feare of God that mooued him therevnto. For concerning the curſe of his father, he was no otherwiſe carefull of it, then in this, that it was imprinted in his heart, that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was eſtabliſhed to be as it were a witneſſe of the promiſe which God had giuen vnto him. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore that Iacob had this, it is a ſigne that he reſted not vpon any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man: but that in the perſone of his father he conſidered that which God had decreed. The other euill was, that hee doubted. Now we knowe that in our life if we be not well certified, we ſhall not remoue ſo much as one finger, to the ende we ſinne not, and that God be not offended. And why ſo? Obedience is more worth than ſacrifice. When therefore we ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to doo any thing, not knowing whether it be lawfull for vs, and whether God doo allow it: this is aſmuch as if we ſhould deſpite God: ſo that we ſhould not know how to eate or to drinke, or to be ſhort, to do any thing: no not ſo much as to remoue a mote, but that all our actions ſhould bee condemned, and that god ſhould haue them in vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deteſtation: &amp; S. Paule alſo pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceth it. For by this word of faith he vnderſtandeth certaintie in the 14. to the Rom. that we be aſſured that that which we do is permitted of God, and is agreable to his word. But ſee Iacob who ſaieth, how ſhall this be? I am not hairie as my brother is. He doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: that therfore is a ſigne that after that he hath obeyed his mother, he ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit euil, &amp; that al
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:7669:153"/> that he ſhould take in hand, ſhould be nothing but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion, &amp; that god would deteſt it. And ſurely ſo had it bin if he had alwayes remained doubtfull, that whatſoeuer he ſhould haue done, being of ſin, it ſhuld haue bin to prouoke the wrath of god: but we ſhal ſee by that which foloweth that he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. But the anſwere which his mother giueth him, is:
<q>The curſe be vpon me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But ſhe was not ſo leane and ſo drie as here ſhe is ſet forth vnto vs, but ſhe ſhewed him that he was choſen of god, &amp; that the birthright belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged vnto him. And in deede we ſhall ſee how he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and that he feared no more when he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his father. Thus then it may eaſily be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Iacob was confirmed, to reſolue him ſelfe and too knowe that the bleſſing which he ſought, could not be diſapointed: in the meane time not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding we can not excuſe him, but that he fel fowly, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the very beginning. The matter was here of the building of his houſe, but Iacob doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth &amp; ſticketh here, not knowing whether it were good or euill. We ſee then that he had a very euil beginning: and conſequently that he had nothing in that caſe but confuſion, had not god holpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. To be ſhort, we ſee as well in Iacob as in Iſaack &amp; in Rebecca, that the grace of God came not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, nor had any entry vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by their own wiſdom, nor by their good means which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted. Lo therfore the defaults which are here: but god hath outgone al their faults and offences, and wrought in ſuch ſort through his infinite mercie,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:154"/> that wee haue good occaſion to bowe downe our heades, and to confeſſe that there is none but only he vpon whom all our happineſſe dependeth, and from whom it proceedeth.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs fall downe before the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie of our good God, in acknowledging of our faultes, and beſeeching him that hee wil open our eyes, that we may alwayes more and more know them, too the ende wee flatter not our ſelues in them: but that wee may ſighe and grone to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne pardon of him: and in the meane while that wee may in ſuch ſorte fight againſt all our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall deſires, that in the ende wee may bee full fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med too his rightuouſneſſe, from which we are yet ſo farre of. And that hee ſhewe not this grace onely vnto vs, but alſo too all peoples and nations of the earth. &amp;c.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:7669:155"/> of his counſaile. It is verie true, that hee will vſe them too ſerue his turne: but hee ſheweth notwithſtanding that hee woorketh all alone and of him ſelfe: and when his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſerue him as inſtrumentes, it is no farther then it pleaſeth him, and not as though hee were bounde by any neceſſitie: yea and albeit that thinges in reſpecte of men goe quite back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde as it ſeemeth, yet this ſheweth that his po, wer is ſufficient, ſo that it needeth no helpe from others.</p>
               <p>Nowe wee haue ſaide, that in this matter of Iacob it may bee ſeene howe hee fell into doubt: and this was contrary too fayth. It behooueth therefore that GOD on the one ſide ſupplied this want. Concerning that, that it is ſaide that he ſhould beare the curſſe: it is for that hee knewe that his father was ordeyned to this, that he muſt ordeyne an inheritour, not only for worldly and tranſitorie benefites, but of the promiſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to the ſpirituall life. He knewe this: and therefore he reſpected not only a mortall ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but the liuing God. Nowe touching Rebecca, ſhee ſayth, the Curſſe be vpon her. We ſee howe ſhee was rauiſhed (as was yeſterday handled) in ſuch ſorte, that ſhee ſpake, as it were at randon: but there is no doubte, that in the meane while ſhee wiſte not, that this could doo no hurt. It is true that ſhee regarded not her faulte. For although ſhee had a good grounde too obeye GOD, and ſo too deale that his election might ſtande in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:7669:155"/> full ſtrength: yet notwithſtanding ſhee ought not in the meane ſeaſon, too haue made ſuch a crafte too beare ſwaye, wherein there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but deceytes and lyes. For GOD (as wee haue ſayde alreadie) is able ynough too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhe his owne woorke, and too bring his owne counſell too an ende: hee needeth not too borrowe any thing of vs. It is not lawfull ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by a ſtronger reaſon, too goe about too ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce his trueth by ourlyes. But Rebecca doth it: ſo that in this behalfe ſhee can not bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed. But this example is not heere ſette bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, too the ende that wee alſo ſhould i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine the like: For it will fall out, that at all aſſayes wee ſhall bee readie too mingle oure fantaſies, that our matters maye goe well: and this is euen as much as if wee thought not God too bee wiſe ynough, or rather as if hee were not ſtronge ynough, or had not the meanes in his owne hande, too bring matters too a good ende and iſſue. But in ſo dooing, wee doo (as a man would ſaye) controule GOD: too ſaye, verye well, let him woorke, but after what manner? Not according too his counſaill, and according too his power and infinite puiſſaunce: but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording too ſome light thing, and wee will firſt of all haue that thing done, whiche wee haue imagined and forged in our owne braine. For wee will ſaye, I fynde this too bee good, this will bee a very good and neceſſarie meane. But are wee ſo ouer wiſe? that wee muſte ſtraight
<pb facs="tcp:7669:156"/> waye enterpriſe this thing, and that wee muſte put our hande too the pye in ſuch ſorte. But marke, God hath not ſo ordeyned by his worde. Loe then a raſhneſſe not too bee borne. And yet is this very common, and euery one ſhall fynde of this vice in his ſeede. But ſo much the rather ought wee too learne too adde nothing of our owne, ſeeing wee haue alwayes this corrupte medlay which wee muſt either this waye or that way driue out of our heades. And when wee ſhall ſo haue wrought after our owne guiſe and faſhion, wee ſhall doo nothing elſe, but marre and ouerthrowe all. But if GOD doo not laye ſuch faultes too our charge, and dooth yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe accompliſhe his woorke: this is not too the ende wee ſhoulde boaſte our ſelues therein: as oftentymes they whiche haue ouerreached them ſelues, can ſaye, O, it is falne out well: yea, but this is becauſe GOD hath pardoned this follie, and that neuertheleſſe hee leaueth not too ſupport vs, albeit we were not woorthie thereof. Let vs learne therefore in no wiſe too excuſe our preſumptions, when God ſhal make that to proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which wee haue naughtely and wickedly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted: but ſo much the rather let vs magnifie his mercie, when wee ſhall ſee that although wee haue fought againſt him, and haue gone about as much as laye in vs too forſlowe his woorke, that hee yet hath not lefte off too giue it his courſe. This is that brieflie whiche wee haue too beare away concerning this place.</p>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:7669:156"/>
               <p>Nowe it followeth after, that Iacob went too ſeeke two kiddes, which hee brought vnto his mother, that ſhee might dreſſe ſome daintie meat, ſuch as ſhee knewe Iſaack loued. And after that ſhee clothed Iacob with Eſaus garmentes, and put the skinnes ſo vpon him, that it ſeemed hee was an hairie and rough man.</p>
               <p>But here men might iudge, that this was a very childiſh deede, and a very toye, foraſmuch as it was a counterfayte meate, for ſhee tooke of a kidde, in ſteede of ſome veniſon: and after that the father had eaten and was well filled, hee bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſonne, and that this was as it were a reward for his dinner: and agayne that Iacob came in a diſguiſed habite, as if hee had bin vppon a ſtage counterfeiting his brother Eſau, vnder colour of his garments, and had his poule, his necke, &amp; his handes: &amp; in al this nothing was ſeene but matter of laughter. But to the end that we ſhould be kept in reuerence, and make our profit of this hiſtorie, let vs learne too looke vnto Gods election wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of mention was made before: For if wee haue not this foundation, it is certayne that in all that Moyſes rehearſeth, wee ſhall not finde any thing that may mooue vs, or giue vs any perſwaſion, that this was guided and gouerned from aboue. But when we ſhall be reſolued, that GOD had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the birthright too Iacob before hee was borne: notwithſtanding wee haue too note, in ſeeing theſe thinges ſo ſottiſhly ordered by men of an vnaduiſed zeale, that therefore wee ceaſſe
<pb facs="tcp:7669:157"/> not too ſay: Loe God who is alwayes vnchaunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, although men through their ſturdie bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and fooliſhe preſumption trouble and turne all vpſide downe, yet neuertheleſſe muſt his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile remayne entier and perfecte. This therefore is that wee haue too note, too the ende wee may make our profit of this hiſtorie. Moreouer, when it is ſayde: That Iacob came to his father, and ſayde vnto him: <hi>I am thy ſonne Eſau, eate and drinke.</hi> Hereby we may ſee how men harden the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, when they haue once attempted to doo any thing of an vnaduiſed zeale, howe they waxe bolder and bolder. At the firſte Iacob doubted: If I (ſayeth hee) be founde as a mocker before my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hee will curſſe mee, but by and by hee ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for nothing, he ſpeaketh as boldly &amp; franck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as if it ſhould haue beene ſayde, that hee was ſure too bee in Eſaus place. But hereby wee haue too note, before wee beginne any thing, to thinke whether wee haue allowaunce from GOD, and whether hee will guyde vs: and too ſee that in all our dooing and enterpriſe, there bee nothing but meere obedience. For if wee beginne once (as they ſaye) too breake our boundes, and that wee imagine too doo this and to doo that, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer at the beginning wee had ſome ſcruple and did make great difficultie thereof, in the ende wee ſhall ſhut our eyes and paſſe further: and when all the obiections of the worlde ſhall come before our eyes, yet wee ſhall become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:7669:157"/>
               <p>Foraſmuch then as men are ſo hardened in their fooliſhe and raſhe counſels, and that wee ſee ſuch a notable example thereof in our father Iacob, ſo much the rather (as I haue ſayde alreadie) muſt wee take heede that wee mooue not a finger breadth, till wee knowe whether GOD will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that which wee doo, and that wee haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken counſell of his woorde: For then wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee too bolde, when wee ſhall bee ſubiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and when there ſhall be no fooliſhe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weening in vs too followe our owne fantaſie. But wee can doo nothing of our ſelues, howe ſmall ſoeuer it bee, which is not too much. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I haue ſayde,) let vs learne too beginne well, to the end, ſuch an end may followe as we ſhould deſire. But in this which is here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tained in Moyſes, wee may haue a figure which ſhall not be vnfitte: and that is, that although Iſaack was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, that Eſau was not there, and that Iacob through his ſleightes obtayned his bleſſing, yet for all this, wee haue here an image of that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing which is giuen vnto vs of GOD: For it is ſayde in the firſte Chapiter of the Epheſians, <hi>That wee are bleſſed with all heauenly graces and ſpirituall gifts.</hi> And after what ſorte? Sainct Paule addeth, <hi>in Ieſus Chriſte:</hi> For if GOD ſhould looke vppon our perſones, wee muſt bee his enemies, and hee muſt needes deteſte vs by reaſon of ſinne. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore it is ſo, it behooueth vs too bee bleſſed without ourſelues: that is too ſaye, in the perſone of our heade.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:7669:158"/>
               <p>And moreouer, wee muſte bee clothed with the robe of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. For what can wee bring, but altogyther filthineſſe and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution? Wee are wholly made in iniquitie: therefore wee muſt bee as ſtinke before GOD: but when wee are cladde with the obedience of his onely Sonne, O then, Loe a ſweete ſauoure, wherein, wee are acceptable vnto him. So that although (as I haue ſaide alreadie) in reſpect of men, there was nothing but confuſion, (and as they ſaye) all was iumbled togyther, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe wee may applie this too our profite. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob was a looking glaſſe of the whole Church: and yet were wee bleſſed in his perſone, as hee was bleſſed in the perſone of his elder brother. For the queſtion is not here, of finding it altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like. If a man ſaye that Eſau reſembled not Ieſus Chriſte: it is very true: but yet in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it needeth not that euery parte and parcell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree togyther: it is ſufficient, that wee ſee ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and likeneſſe in parte: as it is ſayde, that the comming of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte ſhall be as a thiefe in the night. And what? will hee ſteale? It were a fooliſhe thing too thinke thus: but it is ynough that wee ſee, that they which are aſleepe in the worlde ſhall bee taken vppon the ſuddaine. So nowe when hee ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the birthright of Eſau, and that Iſaack re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the perſon of God, and that Iacob was bleſſed vnder the robe and countenaunce of his brother: heerein wee ſee, that that was accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:7669:158"/> which we alledged euen nowe: to witte, that we ſhal be put back if we come in our own name, &amp; in our owne perſon, to get fauour before God: but when we ſhal come there vnder the ſhadow of our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, who is the firſt borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all the Children of God. See how we are receiued. But notwithſtanding it is ſaide: <q>That Iſaack demaunded, who art thou my ſonne? I am thy ſonne Eſau?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But heerein he truſteth not himſelf, &amp; thought it may appeare, that there was ſome fraude: For he ſayth vnto him: <q>Come neere vnto me, that I may feele, whether thou be my ſonne Eſau or no.</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſee heere that Iſaack doubted, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheles, the bleſſing ceaſed not in reſpect of god, to haue his vertue and effect: as alſo it is ſayd that he bleſſed him in the preſence of God. But it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true that if we haue our eyes faſtened vpon I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack, we ſhall ſay that this acte was ill guided, &amp; that he deſerued not to be accounted in any degree of perfection: but that God wrought it, (as I haue ſaide) and not onely when the inferiour meanes failed, but when they were contrary, and that it ſeemed, that this had byn vtterly to aboliſh that, which was determined. But ſo much the rather it behooueth vs well to note, that howſoeuer God vſe men in his worke, and doth them this honour to ſerue therin as inſtruments, yet is there nothing on their parte: and wee may ſaye: <hi>He that planteth,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:159"/> and he that watreth is nothing.</hi> But heere Iſaack in ſteade of planting and watering, did rather pluck vp, and cut of the bleſſing of God to make it bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and without fruite. But howſoeuer it was, yet was God therein ſerued. For whether hee had planted or watred, he had doone it but in parte: but he did it not wholy and as he ought: &amp; yet in the meane ſeaſon (as I haue ſaide) the goodnes of God ſurmounted, what ſoeuer was faultie and vitious in his creatures. Howſoeuer it were, we may well ſay that Iſaack in douting deſerued to be depriued from that ſtate and office which was giuen him, that is to ſay, that hee had loſt the grace of God, wherein the ſaluation of the whole world was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. Loe the treaſure which was committed vnto him: but he by his vnbeliefe deſerued too be ſtripped of it. But God would not ſo haue it. And to whom ſhall we attribute this? It muſt needs be that his mercy be heere magnified, ſeeing that in man there is not only not any helpe thereto, nor any thing that anſwereth vnto it, but quite againſt it. And yet let vs note, that none was more dulled of God then he was. It is true that we ſaw before, that he had dimme eyes, and that he was ſo weake with age, that he was as a man halfe deade: but yet this came not to paſſe naturally, that hearing the voyce of Iacob, he was ſo fowly deceiued that he once thought not, There is ſome fraud in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. He doubteth thereof, and yet neuertheleſſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on, &amp; albeit it were againſt his wil, yet he ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed Iacob in ſtead of Eſau. It muſt needes be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God dulled him, ſo that it was not of age
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:7669:159"/> only. And this is that which I haue ſaid, that God guided his work ſo, that although men hinder &amp; let it &amp; it ſeemeth to haue bin, as if they ſhold draw quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, neuertheles thend &amp; iſſue was ſuch, that it appeareth that God executed that which he had pronounced, following his ſecret election, which was made before the creatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. And ſo we know in al that Iſaak did, ther was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a kind of ſottiſhnes, that he was ſo dul: he had no vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, he diſcerned nothi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, nor had any iudgment, and yet notwithſtanding God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this to preuaile. After what maner? How is it that he maketh the breade which we eate to be of ſtrength to nouriſh vs? when we ſhall haue wel ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten &amp; drunk and ſhalbe refreſhed &amp; ſatiſfied, ſo as he which neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bow his arme nor his legges, ſhall haue new ſtrength to trauel. Shall we ſay that this is bicauſe the bread hath any power, any life, or any mouing? But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we ſee that the bread gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth vs that which it hath not, and the corne and wine &amp; other meates: this is to ſhew vs that God vſeth not his creatures in ſuch ſorte, in any worke that we ſhould occupy our ſelues in that which we ſee with our eye: but that we ſhould alwaies bend to this, that as he diſpoſeth the order of nature, and likewiſe guideth and gouerneth vs, yea and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nature: that many times hee will woorke quite contrary to that, that is accuſtomed vnto vs, in ſuch ſort that we ſhal be aſtoniſhed thereat: and chiefly when the queſtion is of our ſaluation. And yet muſt not we imagine that we bring any thing thither for our parte: but that it is God that muſt
<pb facs="tcp:7669:160"/> accompliſh all, who began it and wil performe it. And moreouer if he worke after a ſtraunge &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woonted maner, and that there be nothing but an outwarde ſhew of folly: let vs knowe (as S. Paule ſaith) that the <hi>follie of God is greater wiſdome, then al the wiſedomes of the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now he calleth it the fooliſhneſſe of God, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: becauſe he worketh in a contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible manner, that we might bee rauiſhed therein thinking, What is this that God will ſay? It ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that he ieſteth and mocketh. We will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thereof euen ſo. And this is the cauſe why S. Paule ſayth, <hi>that it is folly,</hi> becauſe men reſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues vpon their outward ſenſes. But howſoeuer it be, this ſurpaſſeth all the wiſdome of the world. Marke then what we haue to beare away. And when we ſhall wel remember this leſſon here, we ſhall not be as a great ſorte of giddie heades, who take all theſe factes at aduenture, and therevpon mock themſelues, as though all that were here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed by Moyſes, were nothing elſe as a man would ſay, but fooliſh trifling.</p>
               <p>But when we ſhall haue learned this which is here ſhewed vs, by S. Paule, it is certaine that wee ſhall haue another manner of ſobrietie, and that we ſhall not giue ouer to adore the ſecret of God, although at the firſt ſhew he glorifie not himſelf: but we ſhal alwaies look to the beginning &amp; to the ende, and not to thoſe meanes which may giue vs occaſion, &amp; ingender in vs ſome offence, or which may ſwallow vs vp. To be ſhort, we ſee that God
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:7669:160"/> directed Iſaack in ſuch ſorte that he was altogither blind: we wil not ſay therfore that god gaue Iſaac heere any ſight to the end he might do that which appertained to his office, knowing well the cauſe why, and knowing all the proceeding of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: but he was blinded, and yet hee held him as it were by the hande, and led him as a blinde man which ſeeth nothing. And in deede we ſee in the Church, ſomething that anſweareth to this, or els comes very neere it: for (as it was ſaid yeſterday) <hi>The preaching of the Goſpel is the power of God to ſaluation to all beleeuers.</hi> When therfore we preach the grace of God whereby we are reconciled, in aſmuch as our faultes are pardoned vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and that the blood which he ſhed for vs, is the true purgation thereof, too cleanſe vs: Loe then God who openeth the Heauens, and calleth vs vnto himſelfe, albeit the worde proceede from the mouth of a man. But in the meane ſeaſon, I knowe not to whome this ſhalbe auaileable: For euery one ſhall bee a witneſſe of his owne faith: and when I ſpeake &amp; haue not receaued my part therin, woe be vpon me: &amp; I ſhould be more then blinde: as alſo they haue byn who ſhall haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Goſpel, and ſhalbe witneſſes of the grace of God, and ſhall drawe poore ſinners to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, notwithſtanding there is nothing remaining for them but condemnation. And why ſo? For they are as Players in whome ther is no affection nor zeale. So then, God will bee ſerued often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, of a people who are woorth nothing, who
<pb facs="tcp:7669:161"/> are as dogges, &amp; the very offſcouring: &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they are as the miniſters of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, to draw thoſe to ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that are in the way of deſtruction. Moreouer there are mercenaries that preach for their belly, and haue no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde but to themſelues, or els would make them<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelues to be very well eſteemed: and yet are theſe neuertheleſſe the inſtruments of God for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of all beleeuers. And oftentimes the beſt, they I ſay, that acquite themſelues moſt faithfully to doe their duetie, to cal poore ſinners to ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be guides and examples to all others: theſe ſhall not yet finde what God will doe. And why ſo? They ſowe the Seede and knowe not hovve God will make it profite: and oftentimes they weene to bleſſe, and they curſſe. And wherefore? Becauſe it muſt needes be that the vengeaunce of God be prepared for all contemners. The Goſpel is preached, to the end we might find God merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to vs al: but there are many that through their contempt and ingratitude heape vpon themſelues their owne damnation: For the goſpel ſhalbe vnto them <hi>a ſauour of death vnto death,</hi> as Saint Paule ſaith: that is to ſay, a deadly ſauour, that only the breath ſhall be inough to ſwallowe them vp: as we ſee yet at this day, that God worketh by the miniſters of his vvord, that ſome are altogither blinde, other are blinde in parte: For the hyerlings of whome we haue ſpoken, they are altogither blockiſhe and knowe nothing: But the good and faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, although it ſo bee that they knowe that
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:7669:161"/> they haue their eyes dimme, yet they are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant howe God wil make their labour to profite, or in what ſort: and oftentimes their purpoſe is quite ouerthrowen. This then is that we haue too learne. And in the meane tyme, ſeing god hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared vnto vs that his vvord is the ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> way to the heauenly life, and that he wil ratifie al that which ſhalbee pronounced heere by men in his name: let vs keepe vs too that and not doubte (whatſoeuer want ſhalbee in vs, aſwell concerning him that ſpeaketh as him that heareth): that yet neuertheles when we ſhal receiue this word by faith, &amp; it ſhal be faithfully &amp; in trueth handled vnto vs, we ſhal be partakers of this bleſſing. And herein wee may ſee the beaſtlineſſe of al thoſe falſe wretches of the papacie: for marke whervpon they haue founded that Idol which they haue, to make a god of a mor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cel of bread: they ſay if a Prieſt haue no intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to conſecrate, it is nothing, &amp; in that the bread is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into god, it is by the inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of him which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrateth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo as they muſt be Idolaters in all their Maſſes (I ſpeake of their owne doctrine) if they make not this condition. For what know wee (ſay they) whether the Prieſt which conſecrateth, doth his buſines as hee ought, &amp; whether his minde bee vpon his kitchin or cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bermaid: for in ſo dooing the bread remaineth bread: there is no GOD: and why ſo? For ſay they, if his intentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be not there it is nothing. But it is very true that they ſhevve very vvel how one errour draweth another: for bicauſe it ſeemeth to them that there is a chaunge made
<pb facs="tcp:7669:162"/> of the bread into the ſubſtance of our Lord Ieſus Chriſte, for which they haue inuented that ſame charme: they adde ſtraight way the intention: but notwithſtanding we ſee that they knowe nothing of the nature of the Sacramentes. I leaue nowe to ſpeake of this conuerſion which they imagine, &amp; cal tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſubſtantiation: but if he that miniſtreth the ſacrament: &amp; hath this charge and calling, holde the people bound to his intention: what ſhall this be? A wicked man that ſhal baptiſe, he may mock God, and by this meanes quite make fruſtrate the ſacrament, and after when he ſhall miniſter the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Supper, the poore people ſhall ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be mocked, who come thither to ſeeke a pledge of their ſaluation: he therein manifeſtly deſpiteth God. To be ſhort, they muſt holde the power of God, (which he moſt notably ſetteth foorth in the ſacraments) ſhut vp in their fiſt. And what a blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy is this, &amp; how deteſtable? But ſee how far they are come. For it is certain that in the Maſſe, if they had an Angell there, yet it ſhoulde neuer ceaſe to be a diueliſh thing: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwiſe if there were a deuil in the ſupper which is miniſtred, yet it could not let God from acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhing his work. We muſt not looke to the woorthyneſſſe of him which giueth the bread or the wine in the ſupper: But God hath ſo inſtructed vs therin, that he hath giuen power to the viſible ſigne: It is he that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by his holy ſpirit, ſo as we bee not deceiued when we come thither, but ſhall bee truely vnited and ioyned vnto him. Loe then what we haue to
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:7669:162"/> beare away vpon this place, too make our profite therof. But now let vs come to the bleſſing which Iſaack gaue. After he had kiſſed his ſonne he ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:
<q>Loe the ſauour of my ſonne is at the ſauour of a fielde which God hath bleſſed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Albeit we ſee that he was deceiued: yet vnder the ſauour of this borrowed garment, he accepteth Iacob his ſonne, as if he had beene his firſt borne. Loe then how the ſauour whereby we are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto God, proceedeth from him which is the firſt borne in the houſe, to wit, from our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Moreouer he addeth:
<q>The Lord giue thee, the dewe of Heauen, and the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the earth, abundaunce of wheate and wine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Heere at the firſt ſhew a man would iudge, that this bleſſinge imported nothinge but that Iacob ſhould be fat and well nouriſhed: For Iſaack men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth not here any ſpirituall giftes, as wee haue ſhewed before, that it was not for any earthly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, nor for riches, profite or pleaſures that Iacob muſt be bleſſed: How ſhal theſe things ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be reconciled? But we haue to holde this rule that is giuen vs in the holy Scriptures: to wit, that the grace of God was alwaies clothed as it were with ſome figures, vntil that our lord Ieſus Chriſt came. For when the fathers would obtain pardon of their ſinnes, they had ſome beaſt ſlaine, and the blood was ſhed: ſometime the fat was burned, and the blood was ſprinckled. And could a brute beaſt I beſeech you blotte out our ſinnes whereof wee

                  <pb facs="tcp:7669:163" rendition="simple:additions"/> And in this reſpecte was the lande of Canaan as a pledge &amp; gage vnto them, that God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a better inheritaunce for them, then in this worlde. For they might haue returned too the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie where they were borne, which was more fertile then this of Iudaea, as may appeare. Marke Abraham and Iſaack pinched with famine and if they had loked to nothing but to haue bin nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed heere vpon earth, they woulde haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that lande of promiſe. But they reſted there. And wherefore? to inioy it after their death? Of neceſſitie therefore, muſte they thinke of a more high thing then this viſible earth, and they muſte take it in another reſpecte, to ſay, wee haue heere all that we can deſire. But they tooke the land of Canaan as a pledge that God gaue them, vntil they ſhoulde come into the poſſeſſion of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly life.</p>
               <p>So then, when we ſee in this bleſſing of Iacob, that he ſpeaketh of the deaw of heauen, and of the fat of the earth, of abu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>daunce of corne and wine, it meaneth not that Iſaack would onely pray for this, that his ſonne might be fed as an Hog in a ſty, and that he ſhould be fatte and full heere beneath: but he folowed the order that God had appointed at that time: to witte, that he did giue vnto them pledges of a thing that was much more excellent. And that ſo it is, Iſaack addeth a little after:
<q>That his ſonne ſhoulde rule ouer his enemyes, and that all nations ſhoulde bowe their knees before him.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:7669:163"/>
               <p>And by what right giueth he him this? Loe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack a poore ſtraunger that muſt hier the lande where he ſetteth vp his pauilion, and muſt liue as it were by the fauour of an other: and yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe he maketh his ſonne here a King of kings, and all the worlde to come and doe him homage, and that hee ſhall bring the whole earth into ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection. We ſee then very well that hee troubleth not him ſelfe with earthly things: but he ioyneth bothe togither, to wit, he taketh earthly bleſſings as pleadges, to the end to bring his ſonne further off: and in the meanewhile he hath his path right that might leade him to the kingdome of heauen, as was promiſed him. Now we know that things are offred to vs in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, that may make vs forget both honours, and all high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, dignities, and nobilities of the world. This therefore is the thing we haue to marke vpon this place. It is true that euen at this day it muſt needs be that thoſe temporall bleſſinges which wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue from the hande of God, ſhould bee vnto vs as it were pledges of his goodneſſe: but they are ſomtimes more, ſometimes leſſe. For in reſpecte that the auncient fathers had not the like light as wee haue, and were in ſhadowes and figures: this is the cauſe why God woulde not ſo well teſtifie his fauour vnto them, as he hath done vnto vs at this day. For in the goſpel we haue our lord Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; it is ſaid that we muſt be faſhioned after his image. Now we knowe that hee had nothing in this world, but all kinde of miſeries &amp; confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:164"/> for we ſee how he was crucified, ſo as it ſemed that he had bin vtterly forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god his father: he was in extreme diſtreſſes &amp; anguiſhes. Thus then we muſt be faſhioned to him after another faſhion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were, who were ſo led by figures. Further more, when we ſhal compare Iacob with Eſau, we ſhall yet better knowe (as wee ſhall finde after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde) that when Iſaack bleſſed Eſau, that the bleſſing which he will vſe, will be a greate deale more large and rich, then that which he vſeth here towards Iacob his ſonne: and yet neuertheles, this was not to bleſſe him to that heauenly life: but he ſayth vnto him: My friend there be not twoo bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, ſeeing that is taken from mee, it muſt ſtand, and God hath bleſſed him whom I haue bleſſed, foraſmuch as hee hath appointed me the miniſter therof, it muſt needes be that it euen ſo ſtand, as it hath beene don, I haue no more right in it: I muſt holde my ſelfe contented to haue bleſſed once: &amp; yet afterwards he bleſſeth Eſau notwithſtanding. And how? What, is there any contradiction? no not ſo: but this is to ſhewe vs, that there was not any other heauenly bleſſing, to ſay, that he whom he bleſſed ſhould be the head of the church, &amp; that Ieſus Chriſt ſhould come of his race: this was no longer in the hand of Iſaack, as he confeſſeth. But concerning the benefites of this worlde, and that which might ſatiſfie the creatures, hee gaue him more abundauntly, then he did to Iacob. Now then we may eaſely ſee, that Iſaack ſpeaking heere of the deawe of Heauen, of the fatte of the earth,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:7669:164"/> and of great quantitie of corne and wine, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that his ſonne ſhoulde trouble him ſelfe therein: but he ſimply ſetteth theſe figures before him, which were pledges (as I haue ſayd) to draw him further of: This therfore is the thing that we haue to marke. And withall let vs note, that when it is ſayd that Iſaack had declared:
<q>The voyce is the voyce of my ſonne Iacob: but the hande is as the hand of Eſau.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That God had yet purchaſed this for him. It is true that all this was done through errour: but yet beſides this errour he had ſome certain knowledg: and the Lorde did in ſuch ſorte aduertiſe him of it, to the ende to ſhewe that the blesſing belonged to Iacob: as alſo in trueth it muſt bee reſcrued for him, although this had not come to paſſe: that is to ſay, albeit Rebecca had not vſed this il deceite, yet God knewe full well howe too holde Iſaacks mouth, as alſo he held the mouth of Balaam. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde Balaam who was a lyer, who was hyred, &amp; came alſo to curſe the people of God, if it had bin posſible for him, to the ende to get giftes of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach. But neuertheles God did ſo turne his tounge, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he thought to curſſe, (maugre his beard) he bleſſed them. But Iſaack was not as Balaam: For his purpoſe was not to reſiſt GOD, nor too aboliſhe his election: but hee was blinded with a fooliſhe loue which hee bare vnto his Sonne, (as wee haue ſayde): and our Lorde coulde well enough gouerne his tounge when hee woulde,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:165"/> to cauſe him to bleſſe Iacob: but now when hee imagined too bleſſe his ſonne Eſau, yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe doeth GOD drawe this from his mouth, <hi>The voice is the voice of my ſonne Iacob.</hi> Now this was the principall and chiefe of the bleſſing, euen the voyce: For Iſaack gaue nothing of his owne: but he was a witneſſe of the fauour of God, and as it were an Harrault to publiſh it. So then, foraſmuch as he found nothing of Eſau but the apparell and the touching, he muſt not reſt himſelfe therevpon, foraſmuch as he founde the voyce in Iacob. By this we may ſee that God would euen now already allowe it, although that Iſaack knewe not what he did, neuertheleſſe the bleſſing muſt be turned to Iacob. Thus much concerning this word. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer for the concluſion let vs marke well when it is ſaid, that all people ſhalbe ſubiect to Iacob: that this is not to the ende that hee ſhould haue any earthly Empire or dominion in this world, either he or his. It is true, that they ruled in the lande of Canaan: but howſoeuer it was, yet did not they bringe into ſubiection all nations. In the time of Solomon, it is true that God exalted his people far &amp; wide: but this was in a figure: for it muſt come vnto our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who is the head both of men &amp; angels. So then that which Moſes here rehearſeth of the ſoueraigne dominion, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that it can not agree, neither to Iacob nor to his Children, nor to al their poſteritie, vntill that we come too our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. And this is the cauſe why it is expreſſely ſaide, that he ſhoulde
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7669:165"/> bee the heade of his Brethren, and that his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſonnes ſhoulde bowe downe before him. This was not in reſpect of Iacobs perſon: hee had but one onely brother, who bowed not him ſelfe before him: but rather made him afraide, as wee ſhall ſee after: but we ſee the accompliſhment of al in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: &amp; this was not for him ſelfe, but it was for our good and for our ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he receiued all power from God his father, to the ende that euery knee ſhould bowe downe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: In him alſo it is altogether that wee are a prieſtly kingdom, ſo that we acknowledge him as our king and our head to worſhip him.</p>
               <p>But now let vs caſt downe our ſelues before the maieſtie of our good God, in acknowledging of our faultes, and praying him that he will make vs in ſuch ſorte to feele them, that it may be to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vs before him, and for to make vs to aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of him, &amp; alſo for to hate our ſelues, and to be diſpleaſed with our ſelues in our owne vices: and pray him that it would pleaſe him in ſuch ſorte to reforme vs, that we may growe vp more &amp; more in all holineſſe and obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his rightuouſnes. And that hee would ſupport vs in our weakneſſes, in ſuch ſorte, that he leaue not to accompliſhe the promiſes that he hath made vnto vs, although that on our part wee doo not onely ſlacke them, but ſeeme alſo vtterly to thruſt them from vs, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he will not leaue, to ſtretch out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs a ſtrong hande, vntill that wee become vnto the marke which he hath ſet before vs: that is, till
<pb facs="tcp:7669:166"/> we be partakers of that glorie which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed vnto vs through our Lorde Ieſus Chriſte. And that he wil not only ſhew this grace vnto vs, but vnto al peoples &amp; nations of the earth, &amp;c.</p>

When we haue this I ſay, we ſhall haue inough to content vs. But if we deſire that god bleſſe vs in ſuch ſort, let vs firſt take heede, as I haue already touched, that we be the true children of Iacob, not of the carnall race but by faith, &amp; that we be regenerate by the ſame ſpirite, that we may haue the teſtimonie of our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imprinted in our harts, &amp; as it were ſealed, to the end we may haue ful aſſurance thereof: and that in this truſt we may crie out vnto God.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:7669:167"/> this as done to his own perſon, and wil reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<q>That Iacob was euen hardly gone forth from his father, &amp; that ſcarſely he had obtained that he went about, but lo Eſau returned from hunting, and brought meate to his father, he brought it vnto him being vpon his bed.</q>
               </p>
               <p>If we ſhal co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that which is here rehearſed by Moyſes, according to the outward ſhewe, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that Eſau was woorthy to haue bin bleſſed. For he diligently perfourmed that which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyned him by his father: &amp; diſcharged him ſelfe of his duetie. And wherefore then was hee berefte of his birthright? But ſee wherin wee are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time deceued: that is, bicauſe we regard that which vve ſee with the eye. But God regardeth the right and trueth, as Ieremie ſaieth. So then, let vs not thinke that GOD embuſieth him ſelfe in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde hevv, vvhich in deede is nothing: and yet notvvithſtanding vvee are vvonte too be rauiſhed therevvith, in that vvee are ſenſuall men. Too be ſhort, that vvhich hath the goodlieſt gliſter and ſhevve before men, ſhall oftentimes be reiected be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, as the Paynims, they ſet great price vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7669:168"/> their vertues in the outwarde ſhewe which they had: but we muſt come further: that is too ſaye, we muſt knowe that God ſoundeth the hearts and ſecret thoughtes. So an acte may bee highly and greatly praiſed and eſteemed, and yet neuertheles ſhall diſpleaſe God: For if the affection ſhall not be right, there is nothing but hypocriſie &amp; a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble courage in it, or elſe the ende ſhall not bee well ordered. For let vs put the caſe that a man giueth him ſelfe to vertue, and yet hath this fooliſh arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie in him ſelf, to get reputation, and that men ſhould clap their handes at him in the iudgement of the world: he hath nowe alreadie receiued his reward, and becauſe he is led with ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it muſt needes be that all that he doth and taketh in hand, muſt be reiected of God. And why ſo? Humilitie is the foundation and roote of all vertues. As long therefore as men do ſeeke to merite by their owne vertue, it is certaine, that if they were Angelles in outwarde appearance, yet all that procedeth from them, is nothing elſe but baggage and very filth. So let vs learne, that when we ſee how Eſau beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him ſelf ſo to the eye, and that he fayled in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and yet notwithſtanding that hee was caſt vnderfoote, and that God made no reckoning of him, let vs learne (I ſay) not to giue our ſelues too fooliſh ambition to be ſeene of men, and to be wel thought of: but let vs walke in ſimplicitie and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe before God, let vs knowe that if the hart goe not before, that all the ſeruice that we can do vnto him, ſhalbe iuſtly reiected. Marke ſhortly
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:7669:168"/> that which we haue to hold, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning that which Moyſes hath rehearſed here, touching the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which Eſau rendred vnto his father. Nowe there is alſo to be noted further, when wee ſhall make compariſon of him with Iacob, we ſhal find that which was ſhewed before, to wit, that Iacob was not preferred, but by the free goodnes of god of which thing there appeareth no reaſon vnto vs, for lo Eſau which we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to hunt, who lied not, who deceiued not his father, and did not thruſt in him ſelf craftily, neither by any deceit or indirectly: he had none of al this. But what doth Iacob? he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth, hee lieth, and dealeth diſſemblingly, and preſenteth him ſelfe as it were his brother Eſau: there was nothing in him but crafte and theft concerning this matter, and further, he doth greatly diſhonour his father, too make him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue one thing for another. Wee might well ſaye then, that Iacob deſerued too bee reiected and cut of: but neuertheleſſe GOD would that he ſhuld haue the birthright. And whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vnleſſe it be vpon his euerlaſting councell which we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>prehend? And ſo let vs learn to hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble ourſelues: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding that the reaſon be not declared vnto vs why god ſhuld rather accept Iacob the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Eſau, &amp; take the birthright fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to giue it to the leſſer. Albeit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we know not what moued &amp; induced God to this, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding let vs hold for moſt certaine, that he doth nothing but moſt iuſtly, becauſe his will is the rule of all rightuouſnes: hee is ſubiect too no
<pb facs="tcp:7669:169"/> lawe, and much leſſe to our fantaſie, to doo thoſe thinges that ſeeme good vnto vs: but ſo farre of is it, that though wee were able too diſpute and too alledge all the reaſons that poſſibly we could conceiue, yet the onely will of GOD, ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome all the reaſons in the vvorlde: and all that which ſhall enter into our braine, muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie bee ouerthrowen: as it is ſayde, that hee ſhall alwayes bee iuſtified, yea albeit men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempne him. For they rather haue this deuiliſhe pride to murmure againſt that which he doth, &amp; to finde ſomewhat to ſay againſt it, and to bring foorth their reaſons: but when they ſhall haue pratled pedlers french as long as they can, yet ſhal the iuſtice of God remaine vntouched, and they which haue durſt rather too ſlaunder it and barke againſt it, they ſhall remayne aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Loe therefore yet an other principall pointe that wee haue too holde in this place.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is ſayde, that Iſaack asked firſte, <hi>Who art thou?</hi> And hearing that it is Eſau, he was aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, yea Moyſes further addeth more, with a wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful feare. If Iſaack had not knowen how much worth that bleſſing had bin, and that it ſhould bee confirmed by God, if he had not knowen, that he beeing called too the dignitie and office of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch, muſt bee a witneſſe of the inheritance of ſaluation, he had not bin ſo aſtoniſhed: For hee had done as other men vſed too doo. I haue beene deceyued by my ſonne. Hee had ſtormed &amp; chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed agaynſt Iacob, yea and hee would haue cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:7669:169"/> him: and hee would neuertheles haue conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, O, I will keepe my right, howſoeuer it bee, this ſhall no whit preiudice me therin, and I haue my authoritie francke and free. Loe then how I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaack might haue vſed him ſelfe therein, after the common maner. But hee knewe that God had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deyned him the miniſter, to cauſe that the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of ſaluation ſhould reſt in his houſe: and hee knewe that he was but an inſtrument therein, and that this was not becauſe God had reſigned his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to him, albeit hee had communicated it vnto him. For if God communicate his authoritie too thoſe, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath eſtabliſhed in the miniſterie of his word, this is not meant that he depriueth him ſelf of it therfore, neither that he giueth ouer his right therein, in any ſort whatſoeuer. Iſaack knew then, that foraſmuch as he was but an inſtrument of the holy ghoſt, that that which he had pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced muſt ſtande: &amp; there is no doubt alſo but that it was reuealed vnto him. For before hee was as it were, reſtrayned: the loue which he bare to his eldeſt ſonne had ſo beſotted him, that he had quite loſt the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of that which we haue ſeene before: For hee was not ignorant of that whiche God had determined, <hi>That the greater ſhould ſerue the leſſer.</hi> And yet neuertheles, hee is a man as it were altogither ſenſeleſſe &amp; deuoyd of reaſon, alwayes addicted to his ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne Eſau, &amp; thought not to yeeld him ſelfe to be gouerned by God. Nowe this was not of anie deliberate and ſet rebellion, (as wee haue declared before:) but it was loue that blinded
<pb facs="tcp:7669:170"/> him, and for that hee marked not that hee ſhould ſimplie haue reſted in the will of God. Loe howe he ouerhaſtily forgot him ſelfe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> So the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, let vs note that this great feare wherof Moyſes ſpeaketh, was as if a man ſhould ſuddainly come to awaken a man making ſome alarme about him, and as if he had beene ſeaſed with ſome aſtoniſhment, and thought this had bin ſome meſſage of death, and that his enimies had bin euen come to his bed. Lo in what caſe Iſaack was. But here wee haue too note in the firſt place that it is good that God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vs very roughly, when we ſhalbe ſo ſluggiſh, and that he come vnto vs euery day. It is true that we will thinke our ſelues watchful ynough, when we ſhal heare the word of God, &amp; wil be zealous, and it will ſeeme that wee are very warie therein: but al that we haue heard is quickly fled from vs, and ſpecially when wee haue contrarie things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs. If wee haue bin exhorted to patience, and it ſeeme that wee haue bin therein ſo well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that there wanted nothing: let one come too trouble vs, let vs receyue but ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle blowe, incontinent wee will bee ſo enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vvith vvrath and diſpleaſure, that wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get that which was ſpoken vnto vs.</p>
               <p>Agayne, when wee are exhorted too deſpiſe the riches and honours of this worlde, if we be allured therevnto by our aduerſarie the Deuill, wee will bee (as it were) aſleepe in them, and all our ſenſes wil be whollie occupied therewith.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:7669:170"/> Now if our Lord vſed any ſimple admonition, it is certaine that it is as if it were ſpoken to a man that were aſleepe. And what ſhal men profit ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? It behoueth therefore that god awaken vs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes by force. And ſo as often as God ſhall ſcourge vs, &amp; that ſome ſhalbe chaſtiſed after one ſorte, ſome after another: Let vs examine that which was in vs, and ſo wee ſhall knowe that we were for a time blockiſh and ſenſeles, that we haue knowen nothing of that which we ought, or elſe that we were not ſo atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiue therin, &amp; let vs learne by the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of our father Iſaack, that ſeeing our Lord doth ſtirre vs vp and would that we ſhould deepely &amp; in good earneſt think vpon him, &amp; that wee ſhould gather vp all our ſenſes, which before were wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring: let vs learn I ſay to make out profit thereof: Loe this for one leſſon. But let vs marke howe Iſaack willingly ſubmitteth him ſelfe too the will of God. I haue alreadie ſayde, that they that will mainteyne their reputation, wil be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: although they had done the greateſt euill in the world, yet they will alwayes mainteyne it. And loe this is the cauſe that ſo many people plunge them ſelues ſo deepely, euen vntoo the depth of the bottomleſſe pittes: that is, they are aſhamed too bee reclaimed: they would haue the renowme of conſtancie, and they thinke that if they ſhoulde chaunge, that it ſhould bee caſte in their teeth, as a great lightneſſe and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancie. Loe the cauſe why men harden them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in obſtinacie with boldneſſe and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:171"/> too followe a thing, howſoeuer it bee, and take the bitt in their teeth and wil in no caſe bow, neyther too the one ſide, nor too the other. Nowe this is a vice very common, and ſo much the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſhall be ſubiect vnto it, vnleſſe wee come to that which is rehearſed here. Loe Iſaack who might haue bin greatly aſhamed, for that hee was ſo deceyued and abuſed: a man might ſaye, looke vppon this drunkarde, when hee is well whitled, and that hee hath eaten and drunke, he taketh one for another: and farther, a man might haue ſaide, this was a glutton, when hee could not diſcerne betweene kid and veniſon: and againe, it might haue bin ſayde: What? when he bleſſed his yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſonne in ſteede of his eldeſt: being ſo decey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; becauſe he did this through errour &amp; theft: weeneth he that this ſhalbe auaylable before god? Iſaack therefore might haue had many reſpectes, to haue bin obſtinate in his facte. But hee forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all, and knoweth that foraſmuch as it was ſo ordeyned of God, that Iacob ſhould be bleſſed, that it muſt remaine, &amp; no chaunge muſt be made therein. We are then brieflie taught that as often as wee ſhall do any acte vnaduiſedly, which plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not God, or elſe if we ſhall exceed our bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, and goe beyonde our calling, howſoeuer it bee, that wee alwayes turne the bridle, as ſoone as we ſhall bee warned, and that wee followe not the matter, becauſe this is manifeſtly too deſpite GOD. But eſpecially wee haue to conſider, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Iſaack vvere carried with an euill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:7669:171"/> &amp; although hee forgate that whiche had beene pronounced by GOD, that faith was not vtterly quenched in him, albeit it vvas choked. This argument was handled yeſterdaye more at large: yet ought it by the waye too bee further thought vppon. For what mooued Iſaack too ſaye, I haue bleſſed thy brother, albeit hee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it by deceipt, ſhall hee remaine bleſſed yet? What leſſon learneth hee? It muſt needes be that hee knewe this before. Nowe hee knewe it: but as I haue ſayde already, the light of his fayth was as a coale of fire that had beene raked vnder the aſſhes: one ſhould haue ſeene nothing thereof, but let them remooue a fewe of the aſſhes, and then loe the ſparkes appeare by and by, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the fire ſheweth it ſelfe. Euen ſo was it in Iſaack: and this is not written onely for his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone, but too the ende wee ſhoulde gather a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral doctrine therof: For oftentimes the like ſhall fall out and come to paſſe with vs, to witte, that when wee ſhall much looſe the bridle to our vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that one ſhall be rauiſhed with ambition, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſhall be kindled too couetouſneſſe, to heape vp goods, another ſhall haue ſome fooliſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite: too bee ſhort, another ſhall be drawen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye and eſtraunged from GOD, by ſome man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of meane: then loe our faith whiche is (as it were) dead. Nowe God ſuffereth it not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togither aboliſhed: For when the woorde taketh liuely roote in vs, it is an incorruptible ſeede. It can not then be quite rooted out: but howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:7669:172"/> it bee, it can not bee ſayde that there was not one ſparke or droppe of fayth, in ſuch ſorte that wee bee ſo colde, that wee thinke no more of GOD, that the worlde hath quite ouercome vs. When therefore any doo ſo wander, that they thinke onely but on their luſtes, a man woulde ſaye that faith were quite dead. Nowe this maye well be in appearance: but notwithſtanding God yet reſerueth ſome hidden ſeede: as we haue ſaid, that the fire may well bee choked, and yet not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>togyther quenched, when it ſhall bee raked vp vnder the aſſhes. For al our affections, the riches, honours and pleaſures of the worlde, are as aſhes too choke vp this light of God, which ought to guide and leade vs. But our Lord hauing pitie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon vs, bringeth too paſſe, that a little after we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our faultes: and whereas wee were ſo colde, yea as it were altogither frozen, wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to waxe warme, in a good zeale, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto him.</p>
               <p>Loe then, how GOD accompliſheth that in his faythfull, which wee reade here of our father Iſaack. But this is not ſpoken too the ende wee ſhould therefore tempte God, as though it were permitted vnto vs too ſuffer our ſelues in ſuch ſort too bee carried aſtraye by the Deuill, that oure fayth might bee (as it were) aſleepe in our heartes and ſoules: For it will not alwayes fall out, that God will awake thoſe whiche are aſleepe, and call them agayne whiche are eſtraunged from him. Let vs learne therefore to walke in feare &amp;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:7669:172"/> carefulneſſe: and ſpecially when wee ſhall finde men ſo dul, that they ſhalbe as it were altogither blockiſh, and that their faith ſhalbe as it were dead in them: let vs learne too feare ſo much the more. What holineſſe was there in Dauid? And yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe wee ſee that he was for a time, as a man quite deſparate. Afterwards, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted ſuch an abhominable faulte, to haue rauiſhed the wife of another, and to haue cauſed her huſband wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly to bee ſlaine with ſuch vilanous trecherie, that he deſerued to be throwne out from amongſt men: after all this, we may ſee, what manner of Prophet ſoeuer he had beene, what feare of God ſoeuer he had in him before: to be ſhorte, albeit he were a mirrour of Angelicall perfection, we ſee that he was as an Oxe or an Hogge, he knewe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he had no remorſe, it ſeemeth that God had giuen him vp into a reprobate ſence, &amp; had ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him with a ſpirite of blockiſhneſſe: yea and when the Prophet commeth vnto him alledging this compariſon, and ſpeaking vnto him of a neighbour, that through violence had oppreſſed a poore man: ô he knew well to condemne others, and in the meane while thought nothing of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, till that the Prophete ſayde vnto him: It is of thee, it is of thee that I doe ſpeake. Vntill that the Prophete Nathan ſaide vnto him. It is thou murtherer that haſt doone ſuch a deede: vntill that he came to giue him a blowe with a clubbe, as it were a chafed Bul, he continueth blockiſh in it: &amp; foraſmuch as the Deuill had wonne him ſo farre,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:173"/> that he was as it were drunken yea altogither be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, it muſt needs be that God euen thunder againſt him.</p>
               <p>When therefore wee ſee ſuch like examples as this which is heere rehearſed vnto vs by Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that Iſaack the chiefe of the Church, is as it were blinde heerein, vntil that God had reuealed it by force: ſo much the more (as I haue ſayde) it behoueth vs to take good heede to walke in feare and carefulneſſe: and in the meane while let vs learne when GOD giueth vs ſuch puſhes and ſpurres, to make vs returne vnto him, whereas wee were before as it were inſenſible, and haue gotten through long cuſtome ſuch a ſtrong ſauour: Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> god giueth vs the grace (I ſay) to cal back ourſelues vnto him, that we be moued as becommeth vs, &amp; that it be not to wipe our mouth after we haue ſayd in one woord, that we haue faulted, as there are many: but that we followe that which is here taught vs by Moyſes that Iſaack was affraid. And howe? very greatly, yea wonderfully. For it is impoſſible, that we ſhould come to repentaunce, vnleſſe we haue a heauyneſſe that muſt torment vs and we be as it were in hell, to feele our wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and bee therein confounded. Vntill ſo much bee wrought in vs, that wee be come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is certaine that there ſhall bee no repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce in vs. This teacheth howe wee muſte practiſe this doctrine: to witte, That when our Lorde ſhall haue touched vs, that on our partes wee be as it were wounded to the bottome of our
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:7669:173"/> hart, &amp; that we be ſo aſtoniſhed, that we return no more to our ſlouthfulneſſe and negligence, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we were for a time ouerwhelmed.</p>
               <p>Nowe Iſaack yet ſheweth his faith better in ſaying, <hi>He ſhall be bleſſed:</hi> For hee knewe that God had ordayned him to this office, and that he ſpake not in his owne name: For the ſentence of God cannot bee called backe: it behooueth therefore that he kepe him there. So we haue farther to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this place that we haue alredy touched: that Iſaack heere paſſed not his bounde, although hee had fayled through ignoraunce, and beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the perſon, yet he alwayes kepte a good principle: to witte, that hee had executed that which GOD had committed to his charge: and that therefore this muſt remaine concluded, and haue his effect. Nowe this is ſayde for our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: For wee knowe that at this day our Lorde woulde haue the remiſſion of our ſinnes too be ſhewed foorth by the mouth of men, hee would aſſure vs of the inheritaunce of euerlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaluation, and alſo would haue his adoption too bee declared vnto vs. Nowe wee muſte needes haue wherevpon too reſolue our ſelues: For if wee haue not full aſſuraunce of our ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if we cannot call vppon GOD, it is as much as too ſhutte the gate of Paradiſe againſte vs. But in the meane while, Loe a man which ſpeaketh and ſayeth, that hee will pardon our ſinnes, and yet hee is a ſinner him ſelfe. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, hee promiſeth vs the Heauenly life: and
<gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">
                     <desc>〈2 pages missing〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb facs="tcp:7669:174"/> brittlenes. Lo then that which we haue to learne vpon theſe words, <hi>He that hath beene bleſſed ſhalbe ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſed.</hi> And how ſo? Had Iſaack that Priuiledge therein, to ſay that that which he had pronounced ſhould ſtand? After he had eaten and drunk, and further beeing a poore blind man, being ſo block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh that he knewe not what he did: beeing ſo dull that hearing the voyce of his ſonne Iacob, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freth him ſelfe to be led as a poore beaſt: and yet neuertheleſſe ſayth, It ſhal ſtand? Yea but acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging his fault, he is confounded, and neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he continueth: For hee knewe whereto God had eſtablyſhed him, and thereupon he giueth glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to God, and quite caſteth downe him ſelf from his owne vnderſtanding, knowing well that hee had nothing of his owne. And ſo, let vs learne that Iſaack ſo ordred himſelf, and in ſuch ſort reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vpon the word of God, that he altogither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his affections wherwith he was before time caryed away. In the meane ſeaſon wee haue heere a good rule concerning our ſelues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are warned that when we ſhalbe taught, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this be done by the meane of mortal men who are ſent vnto vs, that God doth accept vs and account vs for his owne, that this ought to ſuffice vs, and that we may deſpiſe Sathan and all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, &amp; all things that may come in our braine to ſhake our faith. And thereupon it is ſayd, <hi>That Eſau cryed out, yea by yelling and roaring, and that he howled as it were a wilde beaſte,</hi> and that he deſired notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to be bleſſed: and that his father ſayd vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:7669:174"/> him: Loe it muſt needes be that the firſte bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing holde: and that then he deſpiteth his brother Iacob, and ſayd: It was right that hee was ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. For we haue declared before that Iacobs name was drawen from a heele, as if a man ſhould haue called him <hi>Heeleholder:</hi> and this was foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as hee helde the heele of his brother, when hee ſhoulde come foorth of the wombe. Nowe ſayth he, hee hath giuen mee a blowe with his heele. As if a man ſhoulde ſay, when a beaſte ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth vpon him, that hee hath ſtricken him with his heele. Nowe Eſau applyeth this to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He hath ſuppla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted metwiſe now (ſaith he). And this worde alſo commeth of <hi>Tripping,</hi> when a man giueth one ſecretly a blowe with his foote, and maketh one to fall. Hee ſayth then, that hee hath already tript him twiſe with his heele. The firſt time when he took away his birthright, and now when he took away his bleſſing. Now heere we haue to note in the firſte place, that which the Apoſtle ſheweth vs, to wit, that albeit Eſau wept &amp; mourned, notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding he obtained no place of repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: for he came therto ouer late. And this is according to the exhortatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which we haue made heretofore. It is ſaid that we muſt not be prophane as Eſau was, that we muſt not be giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the earth, nor to al that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerneth our bodyes &amp; this tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſitory life, in ſuch ſort that we ſhould forget the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly life. And why ſo? for (ſaith he) they which prophane themſelues, &amp; defile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy deſires they may cry: but they ſhal find no place
<pb facs="tcp:7669:175"/> repentaunce, foraſmuch as the gate ſhall be ſhutte againſt them. Nowe it is true that this at the firſte ſhew might bee thought ſtraunge: For it is ſayde As often, and at what time ſoeuer a ſinner ſhall mourne and aſke pardon, that GOD will bee ready alwayes to receiue him too mercie, which returne vnto him. Loe the promiſe is generall.</p>
               <p>So then, howe is it that the Apoſtle ſayeth, that wee ſhall not finde place of repentaunce, if wee come too late: For there needes nothinge but too mourne? But this ſhall bee eaſily to bee vnderſtoode, when wee ſhall haue diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed betweene the cryes of the faithfull and of the vnbeleeuers. Both the one and the other ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede cry vnto God: but in diuerſe ſortes: for the faithfull ſhall be touched with true repentaunce, when they cry and when they mourne: It is ſayde likewiſe that Dauid roared, and that his throte was as it were hoarſe. Loe then the cryes which the children of God throwe forth: as it is ſayde that he himſelfe brayed like a Lyon. And a little after we heare what Ezechias ſayth, that his ſpeech fayled him, and that he groned in him ſelf as ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and that he could ſpeake no more: that hee was ſo hoarſe, that he knewe not howe to ſpeake one worde, diſtinctly pronounced: that hee was as it were altogither quite thrown downe.</p>
               <p>We ſee then that the faithfull haue had this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: but in the meane tyme they had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce, which touched them to the quick for their faultes: as it muſt needes be that they diſpleaſe
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:7669:175"/> them ſelues therein, and humble themſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD: and after this they conceiued ſome hope to obtayne pardon. Now the vnbeleeuers they will bray inough, but in the meane while they leaue not off to haue their hearts hardened: teares trickle downe from their eyes, but in the meane while they leaue not off to bee proude and rebellious againſt God: they haue in deede ſome horrour of his iudgements, but this is but too ſette them ſelues in deſpight againſt him: for they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer go ſo farre as to hate their offences, and too be diſpleaſed with them: Loe how it was with Eſau. And therefore we haue to gather that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce, theſe cryes ſhall be reiected of GOD, and ſhall neuer come vnto him. And when the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of repentance, it is not that he meaneth that Eſau had repentaunce: but he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that hee obtayned not mercie, and that God was not mercifull to him.</p>
               <p>And ſo let vs take good heede vnto our ſelues, and let vs deteſte this blaſphemie which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil ſoweth in the worlde, That there needes no more but one good ſighe. For loe thoſe merry Greekes, when they ſhall be exhorted to returne from their wickedneſſes: ô I muſte yet a good while vſe it: and God is a good fellow: Loe yet another blaſphemie as deteſtable, whereat eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very ſtones ſhuld cleaue. And further, God is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful. It ſeemeth to them that vnder the name of mercie they ſhould holde God bound vnto them:
<pb facs="tcp:7669:176"/> but it ſhal be deerely ſold them. Yea lo they come ſo farr that they ſay, O there needes nothing in the end but one good bulke, and one good ſighe. Yea but who is that which ſhall giue it? haue wee it in our fiſt? muſt not God woorke therein? When a man ſhall fal, albeit he haue hurt himſelf, he may well recouer him ſelfe: but if he haue broken his necke, can hee recouer him ſelfe afterwarde? Nowe before GOD all our faultes are deadly: and which is more, it is too put vs and deliuer vs into the handes of Sathan. And can a man ryſe vp, when his necke ſhalbe broken? as I haue alreadie ſaide.</p>
               <p>Nowe it is certaine, that as often as wee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende GOD, it is as if wee brake our necke, as much as lyeth in vs. And ſo, can wee reſtore lyfe too our ſelues after wee haue loſte it? Loe then, what ought to ſtirre vs vp to walke in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and not to tarry til the gate be ſhut againſt vs: but let vs hearken to al the warnings that haue bin giuen vs: and when God ſhall knocke, let vs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen vnto him. And moreouer we haue too holde that which is ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto vs by the Prophet Iſaie: <hi>Seeke the Lorde whileſt hee may be founde: Call vppon him when he is readie to heare.</hi> It is true that the tyme ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no greate matter, that wee ſhoulde take any great aduantage of it: but yet we muſt vnderſtand for concluſion, that this place of Iſaye was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led when the Goſpel was preached, as S. Paule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth in the ſecond to the Corinthians, <hi>Loe the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:7669:176"/> acceptable dayes, loe the time of ſaluation.</hi> And lykewiſe we muſt wel marke the ſimilitude, which is alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto vs by our Lord Ieſus Chriſt that wee let not the occaſion ſlippe: but when God biddeth vs that we come vnto him, let vs come vnto him, yea haſting our ſelues, and let vs not drawe our legges to come ſlowly, leaſt our vnthankefulneſſe in the end ſeclude vs, and that the gate be ſhut againſt vs. Let vs take good heede, I ſay to al theſe exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, &amp; ſo let vs make our profit of them, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing founde place of repentance before God, wee may, after we haue bewailed our faultes, haue our mouth open to reioyce in him, and too prayſe his holy name, for that he ſhall haue beene mercifull vnto vs.</p>
               <p>But nowe let vs throwe downe our ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the maieſtie of our good GOD, in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging our faultes, praying him that hee will in ſuch ſorte make vs too feele them, that it bee not too keepe vs longe in them, nor to ſlugge or flatter our ſelues in them: but in ſuch ſorte too returne vnto our iudge, that aſking mercy in him wee may there finde it in him: and that it be not onely to the ende that he enter not into accompt with vs, to impute vnto vs our iniquities and offences: but that by his holy ſpirite he wil purge vs, and that wee may bee more and more refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: and that he awaken vs, that wee be not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate in our faults: but that wee thinke vppon all
<pb facs="tcp:7669:177"/> the corrections whereby he woulde drawe vs from the euill way, wherein we haue ſtrayed, and that wee make ſuch profite of all the aduertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes which hee giueth vs, that wee be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to bee condemned of him, to the ende to obtayne mercie. That not onely hee will ſhewe this fauour vnto vs, but too all peoples and nations of the Earth, &amp;c.</p>

            <head>¶ <hi>An Anſweare to certaine ſlaunders</hi> and blaſphemyes, wherewith certaine euill <hi>diſpoſed perſons haue gone aboute to bring the</hi> doctrine of Gods euerlaſting Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination into hatred.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Earely beloued brethren we muſt not be amaſed if the article of the euerlaſting predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, be ſo aſſaulted and fought againſt by Sathans mayntainers, ſeeing it is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of our ſaluation, and alſo ſerueth for the better magnifying of the free goodneſſe of God towards vs. On the other ſide thoſe Dogs which bark againſt it thinking to haue a good and fauourable cauſe are therin more hardye: as in very trueth there is nothinge more contrary to mans vnderſtanding, then to place the cauſe of our ſaluation in the good will of God, in ſaying, that it belongeth to him alone to chuſe vs: without finding of any thing in vs wherefore hee ſhould chooſe vs: and after hee hath choſen vs, to giue vs faith through which we ſhould be iuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But what? In aſmuch as he is not bound to the perſon, it is good reaſon that he be left in his meere libertie to giue grace vnto whome he will, and to leaue the reſt in his perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But I deferre my ſelf to intreate more largely of this matter, becauſe you maye haue large diſcourſe thereof in thoſe Bookes which are imprinted: which ought too
<pb facs="tcp:7669:178"/> content you. Concerning the writing which was ſcatered about, to aboliſh this article of our faith, in very truth it deſerueth no anſwere: being on the one ſide ſo ful of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce &amp; beaſtlines, that euery one ought eaſily to iudge thereof: &amp; on the other ſide ſo ful of impudencie, that it is a wonder how theſe troublecoaſts &amp; ſhameles deceiuers, abuſing ſo vilainouſly the holy Scriptures ſhould be hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened vnto: notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding becauſe I haue vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtode that there are yet ſome ſimple &amp; weake ones that are trobled therwith, I therfore thought good to take the payn to ſhew the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that wil ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues teachable: how they ought to reſolue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, to the end they might be no more deceiued by theſe deceiuers.</p>
            <p>In the firſte place, hee that hath made that writing, were it <hi>Sebaſtian Chaſtalio</hi> or ſom ſuch like: to ſhew that God hath created all the world to be ſaued, he alledgeth that he laboureth to draw vnto him all that went aſtray: the whiche I confeſſe in reſpect of the doctrine of faith and repentaunce, the which he propoundeth to all in generall: be it to draw his elect vnto him, or to make other inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable. God then calleth euery one to repentance and promiſeth all thoſe that returne vnto him, too receiue them to mercie. But this meaneth not that he toucheth to the quick by his holy ſpirit, al thoſe to whom he ſpeaketh: as it is ſaid by Iſay in the 53. chapter. <hi>His arme is not reuealed to al thoſe that heare.</hi> To which agreeth the ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of our lord Ieſus Chriſt <hi>None can come vnto me, except my father draw him.</hi> And
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:7669:178"/> the holy ſcripture ſheweth throughout, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion is a ſpeciall gifte of God. And in deede the place of Ezechiel, whereof this troublecoaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his buckler, very wel confirmeth my ſaying. For the Prophet hauing ſaide, <hi>that God wll not the death of a ſinner,</hi> addeth, <hi>but rather will that hee returne and liue.</hi> Whereby he ſignifieth that God biddeth and exhorteth all which are gone aſtray too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the right way. But not that in deede he leadeth them all to himſelfe by the power of his ſpirit. The which hee promiſeth not, but to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, which appeareth aſwel in the 31. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ieremie, as in the 37. of Ezechiel and in the 11. and throughout the whole ſcripture.</p>
            <p>The ſeconde reaſon of this wryting is, that all menne are created too the image of GOD, the which hee ſaieth not to haue beene aboliſhed but onely ſubiected to euil. As though it behooued man at aduenture to beleeue his ſimple ſaying. But contrariwyſe the Scripture ſheweth, that albeit there remain yet ſome trace of the image of God in vs, yet that the whole is disfigured, ſo as reaſon is blinde, and the hearte peruerſe: wherfore by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wee are wholly accurſed. Wee ſee therefore at the leaſt, that by the wil and decree of God, we haue bin al ſubiect to euerlaſting da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> through the fall of one man. Concerning that which this troublecoaſte addeth, that if wee beleue, we are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered through Chriſt by the power of the goſpel, &amp; of the holy ghoſt: that ſerues for nothing, but to confirme our doctrin. For it behoueth that we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
<pb facs="tcp:7669:179"/> come thither, that none beleeue, vnleſſe thoſe which are ordayned to ſaluation Acts 13. &amp; all the ſcripture is full therof. Wherfore this is as much, as if he ſhould ſay, that the elect of God are deliuered from that common damnation through faith.</p>
            <p>The third article contayneth an horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie that if God haue created men to dampne them, his will and the Diuels is all one. They that ſpeake ſo, ſhew playnly enough that they are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither mockers of God, and deſpyſers of all reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It pleaſed God that Iob ſhoulde be robbed and ſpoyled: to be ſhorte, all that is there attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Deuill, and to thoſe theeues and rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, it is ſayde plainely, that it came not too paſſe but by the good pleaſure of GOD. Muſte wee therfore conclude that Gods wil and the Deuils are all one? But they that knowe that the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of God are bottomleſſe, and ſhall haue once knowen their owne weakeneſſe, will adore them with all reuerence and humilitie and know well too put a difference, although that GOD willeth the ſame thing that the deuil doth, yet that this is indeede in diuerſe reſpectes. And ſo, that he deſerueth alwayes to be acknowledged righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, although that his counſell be incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible vnto vs.</p>
            <p>Afterwardes too aboliſhe the Election of GOD, ſeeming as though he woulde confeſſe it, he anſwereth that God hath not cteated nor predeſtinated any man not to beleeue, ſeeing he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7669:179" rendition="simple:additions"/> euery one. Wherein hee ſhewed that hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer yet learned the ABC of Chriſtians, ſeeing he knoweth not how to diſtinguiſh betwene the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward preaching, which is done by the mouth of men, &amp; the ſecret calling of God whereby he tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the hartes within. Now when it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the laſt of Marke, to preach the Goſpell too all, this importeth not that God therfore worketh in all by the power of his ſpirit: and when it is ſaid in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt too Timothie, <hi>that God would all men to be ſaued,</hi> the ſolution is added by and by, <hi>that come too the knowledge of his trueth.</hi> Wherefore then is it, that he him ſelfe would not at that preſent time, that the goſpel ſhould be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to all? ſo farre of is it that he hath enlightened all the world in the faith. It is maruelous that this ſhameles forhead, is not aſhamed too alledge for him ſelf the 10. to the Romanes, where the text ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely ſetteth forth that all beleeue not the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, becauſe that Iſay ſaith, <hi>that the arme of the Lord is not reuealed to all.</hi> Alſo the 6. chap. of S. Iohn where Ieſus Chriſte expreſſely pronounceth, <hi>that all that are giuen him of his father come vnto him.</hi> And touching that, that he ſaith, <hi>that all ſhalbe taught of God:</hi> it is a ſpeciall promiſe made to the Church: as alſo the Lord Ieſus Chriſt was a faithfull expoſitour ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſaying: <hi>He therefore that hath heard and learned of my father, ſhall come vnto me.</hi> Whereby he ſheweth, that all are not inwardly called. According as a little after alſo hee confirmeth the ſame. <hi>Therefore I haue ſaid vnto you, that none can come vnto mee, vnleſſe it be
<pb facs="tcp:7669:180"/> giuen him from God my father.</hi> Notwithſtanding this Ruſtick imagineth he hath well eſcaped, hauing ſpoken a word of predeſtinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, without making any ſemblance of the text ſo expreſſely ſet foorth, wher it is ſaid, <hi>that God wil haue mercie, vpon him on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wil haue mercy, &amp; that our ſaluation is of the ſame mercy: &amp; not of the willer nor of the runner, and that before the two twinne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> were borne, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had neither done good nor euill: to the end the purpoſe of his electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſure, he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the one, &amp; reiected the other.</hi> Alſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we beleue that this proceedeth of that, that God hath choſen vs: Therevpon it foloweth, that the reſt of the world remaineth blinde. But becauſe it would be to long to alledge all, conſider thoſe places whiche are gathered in a little booke that our brother maſter Beza hath made thereof, and you ſhalbe fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied therein.</p>
            <p>To ſhew that the hardening of Pharao, proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not of God, he alledgeth that which is ſaid in the third and fourth of Exod. I haue commanded thee, to let my people depart and thou wouldeſt not. But it foloweth not therevpon, that God had not ordeyned Pharao to be glorified in his obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie &amp; hardnes, as he proteſteth, Exodus 9. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And Saint Paule alledgeth it in this ſenſe in the 9. chapter to the Romaines. This therefore is ſottiſhly concluded of this impudent fellowe, that our will is the firſt and chiefe cauſe of euill. I confeſſe in deede, that it is the neere cauſe, and the true roote of our condemnation. But too the ende a man may graunt him, hee alledgeth the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:7669:180"/> authoritie of Amerbachius, who is a lawier, and as skilfull a Diuine, as a Poticarie is a good butcher.</p>
            <p>Concerning Melancthon, if this Ruſtike reſted not him ſelfe vppon him, as hee proteſteth, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Goſpell, howe prooueth hee by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that God hath not ordeyned of his creatures? Touching that hee imputeth vnto vs, that we put a fatall neceſſitie as the Stoikes doo, it is a verie vilanous ſlaunder: For the Stoikes, they made god him ſelfe ſubiect to ſuch neceſſities, making a net of obſcure cauſes, wherein God was entangled. But wee ſet the Lorde and maiſter in full libertie, attributing the ſoueraigne Empire too his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, too diſpoſe of all things. Concerning that this Clowne babbleth of Free will, it is ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reiected throughout the whole Scripture. For Freedome and bondage are contraries. Nowe, that wee are the ſeruauntes, yea the ſlaues of ſinne, there needeth not that we aledge one place alone, ſeeing the whole Scripture are full thereof.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding, too gyue ſome colour too his errour, hee alledgeth that Ieruſalem woulde not receyue the grace of God, yea as though this prooued Free will, too chooſe good or euill. You ſhall finde throughout all my bookes, howe I haue taught, that wee muſt not ſeeke the cauſe of our perdition any where elſe but in our ſelues, and in our peruerſe will. But it follovveth not, that it is in vs too chaunge our will, which is altogither giuen too euill.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:7669:181"/>
            <p>You ſhall alſo finde that I haue taught that which this troublecoaſt ſetteth down here to put out the whole light: to witte, that our wil is the cauſe or meane to come to ſaluation. Wherfote it nedeth not to alledge that Abraham beleued God, &amp; that it was imputed vnto him for rightuouſnes. For in very trueth it muſt needes bee that a man muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the grace of God. But the queſtion is of kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing what is the firſt cauſe. And this is the power of the holy ghoſt, thorow which we are drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the obedience of god, according as he hath choſen and adopted vs for his children before the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. Nowe in this behalfe this vile dogge ſheweth ſufficiently ynough, that he makes no acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the holy ſcripture, the which aſmuch as lies in him, he would aboliſh or tread vnder his feete. For in going about to declare how Abraha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was ſaued by his wil, he ſaith that this was of that wil which God had put in man creating him after his owne image. Whereby he vtterly aboliſheth the whole grace of the holy ghoſt: and goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yonde not only the Papiſtes, but alſo ſome of the Paynims, in this impietie. For the Papiſtes keepe ſuch a meaſure in magnifying their Freewill, that they confeſſe, being corrupted and depraued, wee can do nothing, if God through his ſpirit &amp; ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall grace, do not helpe, driue and direct vs. But concerning the holy ſcripture, it ſheweth vs, that we ſhal alwaies be rebelles againſt God, vntil that he ſhal haue chaunged &amp; renewed vs. And loe why Moyſes ſaid to the people, Deutero. 29. that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:7669:181" rendition="simple:additions"/> God had not yet giuen them an vnderſtanding hart, and ſeeing eyes. And therfore to the ende hee might be obeied, he ſaith, that he would giue them a newe heart, taking away that ſtonie heart. Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in the 31: Ezechiel in the 11. &amp; 37: &amp; S. Paule in the 2. to the Philipp. that God giueth both too wil &amp; to performe. And in the firſt of S. Iohn it is ſaid, that they which beleeue, are not of the wil of fleſh nor blood: but renewed of god. And S. Luke ſpeaking of the woman, ſheweth wel, how all are drawen vnto faith: to wit, that God openeth the heart, to the end his word may be vnderſtoode. Now it is certaine that theſe things are not ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon order of nature. And yet this villain dareth alledge that which S. Paule ſaith in the 3. Chap. to Titus, that God hath ſaued vs not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our works, but according to his mercie: to inferre vpon that, that we haue Free will, but not ſo conſtant. Now when S. Paule ſpeaketh in the 3. to the Roma. of the will of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſuch as it is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he decyfreth plainly inough, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but peruerſitie and malice: as alſo in the 8. chap. he ſaith, that al our thoughts are enmities to God. Mark the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how this agreeth with that which this ttoublecoaſt chatteth, ſaying that God renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs, after that we haue conſented to his calling. And he is not aſhamed to alledge to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the 5. to the Epheſia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, where he ſpeaketh ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as of the fables of Marlin: but contrariwiſe he ſaith in the ſame epiſtle: When you were dead in your ſinnes, and the captiues of Satan, and that ye
<pb facs="tcp:7669:182" rendition="simple:additions"/> were the children of wrath as others, God hath quickened you, &amp;c. And in the firſt chap. he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wel, that faith and regeneration proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no other thing, then Free election. And in deede, it muſt needes be that God accompliſh in vs that which he hath ſpoken by his prophet Eſaie, in the 66. chap. I appeared vnto them, which ſought me not. And loe why Iohn Baptiſte, reproouing the rudenes and hardnes of his diſciples, ſaith in the 3. chap. of S. Iohn. No man can receyue any thing, vnleſſe it be giuen him from heauen. And which is worſt, this troubler is not aſhamed alſo to bring this place, that God giueth both to wil and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme, to make vs beleeue, that the grace of God followeth our good will: howſoeuer it be that S. Paule in that place without leauing any thing too men, would attribute the whole praiſe of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to God: as he ſaith in the firſt chap. that hee which hath begonne the good work of ſaluation, will finiſh it. Wherein it muſt bee, that he make the grace of god to come after the taile of Frewil.</p>
            <p>Now afterwards this troublecoaſt taketh great payne to proue, that there is a wil in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as though any man had euer denied it. But he ſhould ſhewe, that that will is Free too chooſe good and euill. Nowe howe proueth he it? by the 7. chap. to the Romanes, that this place can not be wreſted. But herein men may eaſily iudge, howe his minde is froward &amp; peruerſe, ſeeing that S. Paule declareth there, although his will laboured and ſtriued too good, inaſmuch as it was regenerated by the ſpirit
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:7669:182"/> of God, yet oftentimes he went but hopping vpon one foote. He alledgeth a litle after the 7. of the 1. Epiſtle to the Corin. where he ſpeaketh of a mans will, that hath a daughter to marie. Here is good ſtuffe to founde Freewill. Concerning the 30. of Deuter. where it is ſaid: I ſet before you this daye life &amp; death, chooſe you: S. Paule in the 10. to the Roma. giueth a ſufficient ſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that is, that Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes preſuppoſeth that God putteth his word in the heart. And loe why it is ſaid, that this ought to be layd to the goſpel. Concerning that of Eccleſiaſt. which notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding is Apocripha, there he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth but of the outward doctrine, but the inwarde grace is a thing apart and by it ſelfe. That which is ſoyl fauouredly iumbled togither by this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blecoaſt, that vnder the ſhadowe that Ieſus Chriſt calleth al thoſe that are heauie loade<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cludeth that grace is giuen equally to all. But hee maketh no rekoning that Ieſus Chriſte after hee had prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched more excellently then al creatures, ſaith by &amp; by, that his father muſt draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beleue in him.</p>
            <p>In the end going about to ſalue that place of S. Paule where it is ſaid, that if a potter make veſſels of earth as he ſeeth good, this ſheweth that God diſpoſeth of his creatures: I pray you marke wel, the goodly ſolutions that he giueth: that God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſheth by miracles, or diſeaſes both one and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as ſemeth good vnto him. As if S. Paule ſpake not expreſly there, that God according to his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geable purpoſe, either choſe or reiected men,
<pb facs="tcp:7669:183"/> before they were borne, or before they had done either good or euil: too ſhewe that it is neither of the willer nor of the runner, but of his mercy, that his elect are ſaued. Such premiſſes are woorthie ſuch a concluſion as he maketh, let vs drawe neere vnto God, and conſent vnto him, and he wil draw neere vntoo vs. As though the firſte approching were not, that he ſhoulde ſeeke vs out, whileſt that we are farre from him. It is true that God oftentimes vſeth this ſpeech, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto me, &amp; I will come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you: but this is to ſhewe what is our duetie and not what our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is.</p>
